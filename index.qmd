# Overview {.unnumbered} 

In this book, you will find the resources you need to complete the qualitative project for your Research Methods 2 course. 

We will work through the book step-by-step, linking to relevant sections on Moodle. However, as the resources are made available from the start, you will also have some flexibility to work at a pace that suits you. 

You will become familiar with the book in the labs, as it supports the teaching there and helps guide you through the two main summative assignments for this course (the group proposal and the individual report). 

You will find links to each chapter at the left hand side of the page, and then there will be links to each heading within a chapter at the right hand side.
