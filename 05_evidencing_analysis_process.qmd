# Evidencing the Analysis Process for your Report (Individual)

This year, we have incorporated a process where we ask for you to evidence each stage of your analysis. There are many reasons for this, including that it is important for research rigour and clarity, and that it helps to demonstrate each step and how they have built upon each other to your marker. 

Please note, that evidencing your work is a requirement and not doing so will negatively impact on your grade for the qualitative report, as the inclusion of this information is one of the Intended Learning Outcomes (please see the Assessment Information Sheet on Moodle for more information).
