Some questions are dependent on each other, but most are independent.\nBoth worksheets have 19 questions each. Some questions are worth 1 point and some are worth 2 points. You can see how much each task is worth on the worksheet.\nThe points on each worksheet will total to 22.\nYou will be presented with three types of questions: error mode, code writing and multiple choice\nFor error mode, instead of asking you to write the code yourself, we’re going to provide you with code that has errors in it. This code will either not run and it will produce an error message, or it will run, but it won’t produce what it is supposed to. In both cases you have to fix the code to produce the intended output. The purpose of these tasks is to resolve errors and learn to debug, so please don’t ask on Teams about the errors you get on the error mode tasks.\nFor code writing, you will be given instructions on code that you should write. Provide the code that gives exactly the intended output (and only that). For some questions, you will be provided a data frame or a plot in the instructions file, and you will be asked to recreate that in the task. You should replace the NULL in the code chunk with your code.\nFor multiple choice, you will be asked questions about the data or interpreting your statistical output. Please replace the NULL in the code chunk with the number of the option you think is correct. Please only use a single number, do not use words, and do not put the number in quotation marks."

This means students’ work should not contain:\n\nplagiarised content; or\ncontent that has been produced by another person, website, software or Artificial intelligence (AI) tool (except where AI use is explicitly permitted); or\ncontent that has been prepared jointly with any other person (except where this is explicitly permitted); or\ncontent that has already been submitted for assessment by the student at this or any other institution, known as self-plagiarism.\n\nStatement on groupwork: We encourage students to form a study group and peer feedback groups. However, this assignment is not a group work assignment, so your work must be your own individual contribution. If you make a study group or a peer review group, avoid sharing final drafts or near final drafts of your work.\nUniversity statement on AI: The University of Glasgow recognises the value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in academic and professional workplaces.The university has a responsibility to ensure that students acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and other competencies associated within their discipline. The Student Learning Development service provides general guidance and support for students on the use of generative AI. Each item of assessment in your courses will have specific guidance about the use of AI. Where generative AI restrictions are in place, they have been carefully designed to maximise your learning opportunity whilst discouraging reliance on generative AI in a way that undermines your learning or development of good professional practice and graduate attributes.\nStatement on use of generative AI: The current assessment is summative, meaning that it contributes to your course grade. The purpose of this assessment is to develop and practice coding skills and data analysis. You can use AI as a learning assistant to explain code, to understand error messages and help documentation, and as a rubber duck to help articulate problems. If you want to use translation software (i.e., code in another language first) be cautious as the syntax produced by generative AI is not always in keeping with the current coding language and can result in incorrect answers.\nAvoid using AI to write your code as you risk not fully understanding the analysis and so you fail to build a foundation for future coding/analysis tasks. Avoid using AI to write comments for your code, as commenting helps you to articulate what you did and also helps you to understand the analysis and results more deeply.\nThere is no expectation that you will use generative AI, and we have no evidence that its use will confer an advantage for this assessment. If you do use generative AI, you MUST acknowledge use in-text via citations and referencing and in an appendix with a declaration of AI use as appropriate. If you choose to use it, we recommend that you use the Microsoft Edge Browser with Copilot and sign in with your university account using the multi-factor authentication to ensure that your work is private and secure. Please keep a log of your use of AI as we may ask to see this.\nFor this assignment, we will consider it a misuse of generative AI if you do not acknowledge using it. Declare all uses of AI, including initial exploration of the subject, literature searching, writing and editing, corrections for grammar and spelling, as well as any other tasks from the course. Be aware that AI may not represent the best response for this task, and you need to take responsibility for everything that is submitted."

Each question will be worth 1 or 2 points, with all questions adding up to 22 points for each worksheet.\nThe computer-assisted marking code that we use checks that the objects in each code chunk are identical to the solution. It is therefore crucial that you follow the instructions carefully and do not change the names of the objects or the code chunks. These instructions are clearly stated in the submission files and you will lose marks if you provide the correct code but change the names.\n\n\n\n1.11.2 How will the feedback from assessment help me in the future?\n\nThis assessment will help you in any future work that requires working with quantitative data such as your dissertation project or future postgraduate courses.\nAdditionally, R can be used for tasks such as conducting text analyses and building websites and therefore is an extremely useful transferable skill.\n\n\n\n1.11.3 What feedback will I receive for this assessment?\n\nYou will get a feedback sheet for each data skills worksheet that tells you your score for each question and the correct solution.\nThere will be additional generic feedback provided for questions with common mistakes and to explain the answers if necessary beyond the solution.\nFinally, there will be individual feedback for any incorrect answers as necessary.\n\n\n\n1.11.4 Who assessed my work?\n\nThe worksheets will be graded using computer-assisted marking. In the first instance, the marking will be done automatically using R and then any incorrect answers will be checked manually.\n\n\n\n1.11.5 Can I get more feedback?\n\nYes! We encourage you discuss your assessment (regardless of the grade you received) with Wilhelmiina Toivo, who is in charge of marking this assessment.\nYou can do so by attending her office hours, or contacting her directly to arrange an appointment if you cannot make the office hours.\n\n\n\n1.11.6 What if I don’t agree with my feedback or grade?\n\nYour first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with the course lead.\nFollowing this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures. There are only three grounds for appeal:\n\nUnfair or defective procedure\nFailure to take into account medical or other adverse personal circumstances\nThere are relevant medical or other adverse personal circumstances which for good reason have not previously been presented.\n\n\nYou cannot appeal against academic judgement."

This means students’ work should not contain:\n\nplagiarised content; or\ncontent that has been produced by another person, website, software or Artificial intelligence (AI) tool (except where AI use is explicitly permitted); or\ncontent that has been prepared jointly with any other person (except where this is explicitly permitted); or\ncontent that has already been submitted for assessment by the student at this or any other institution, known as self-plagiarism.\n\nStatement on groupwork: This is a group assignment and one person from the group should be nominated to submit the final version of the assignment on Moodle. Your group’s work should not be exactly the same as that of another group in the class, however, as you worked closely from common templates, we know that there may be some unavoidable similarities.\nUniversity statement on AI: The University of Glasgow recognises the value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in academic and professional workplaces.The university has a responsibility to ensure that students acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and other competencies associated within their discipline. The Student Learning Development service provides general guidance and support for students on the use of generative AI. Each item of assessment in your courses will have specific guidance about the use of AI. Where generative AI restrictions are in place, they have been carefully designed to maximise your learning opportunity whilst discouraging reliance on generative AI in a way that undermines your learning or development of good professional practice and graduate attributes.\nStatement on use of generative AI: The current assessment is summative, meaning that it contributes to your course grade. The purpose of this assessment is to provide an opportunity to develop your writing and communication. You can use AI as a learning assistant to help understand lecture content, to give feedback on your work, and to help in finding spelling and grammatical errors. If you want to use translation software (i.e., you write the assignment in another language first) be cautious as the vocabulary and syntax produced by generative AI is not generally in keeping with the current language use and vocabulary in our field and can result in subtle misunderstanding in communication.\nAvoid using AI to draft your assignment or structure your work, as these are specialist skills that you need to practice. Avoid using AI to make your citations or reference section, as there is a risk that it will fabricate information.\nThere is no expectation that you will use generative AI, and we have no evidence that its use will confer an advantage for this assessment. If you do use generative AI, you MUST acknowledge use in-text via citations and referencing and in an appendix with a declaration of AI use as appropriate. If you choose to use it, we recommend that you use the Microsoft Edge Browser with Copilot and sign in with your university account using the multi-factor authentication to ensure that your work is private and secure. Please keep a log of your use of AI as we may ask to see this.\nFor this assignment, we will consider it a misuse of generative AI if you do not acknowledge using it. Declare all uses of AI, including initial exploration of the subject, literature searching, writing and editing, corrections for grammar and spelling, as well as any other tasks from the course. Be aware that AI may not represent the best response for this task, and you need to take responsibility for everything that is submitted."

    "text": "5.2 Week 2 Lab 2: Groupwork and RQs\nIn Lab 2, you will form into the groups that you will be in for the rest of the semester. You will be able to find your group in the spreadsheet at the bottom of the Week 2 Moodle (please note the spreadsheet will only become available once it has been released at the start of Week 2). In these groups, you will a) design, run and transcribe a focus group with a group in your lab as your participants, b) participate in another group’s focus group, and c) write a qualitative group proposal.\nIn today’s lab, there will be some time spent getting to know each other, then we will ask you to develop a group agreement (see below). You should also discuss the different topics that you can choose for your project (see Chapter 6.3 in this book), seeing whether any stand out as preferred options among the group.\n\n5.2.1 Lab 2 Activity 1: Group Agreements and Task Allocation\nWe appreciate that group work can be challenging and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and rules that each of the group members is committed to.\nAfter you have all introduced yourselves, download the group agreement template. Then look at the list of potential items to include. These are provided within the template document itself, as well as in Chapter 6.2.1. As a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list.\nAfter this, you should allocate tasks for the group proposal among the members of the group. A starter list of tasks is provided in the template as well as in Chapter 6.2.2. The task allocation must be uploaded in the same document as the signed group agreement.\nWork on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement and allocation of tasks for the group proposal. Once the group is happy with their agreement, each group member should sign it and submit it to Moodle individually (Formative Assessment Section). You can either all sign the same document and upload a copy each, or you can sign separately and upload the copy that only you have signed. Each person should submit their signed group agreement and task allocation before their lab in Week 3.\nOnce the deadline has passed, we will be in touch with any groups where any members have not uploaded a group agreement and task allocation for the group proposal.\n\n\n5.2.2 Lab 2 Activity 2: Research Questions\nIn your groups, have a look at the Topic Guide. There are three topics to choose from: Green Spaces, Belonging and Mental Health.\nAs part of the group allocation, you will have been asked what topic you preferred. Are you all in agreement? Either way, have a look over the topics together. You might know immediately what you’d like to focus on, or might need to discuss all of them in your group.\nOnce you’ve chosen a topic (you might not manage this in the lab, which is fine!), have a think about possible research questions. You will need to have a finalised RQ for your group proposal, which is submitted in Week 5."

    "text": "5.3 Week 3 Lab 3: Ethics\nIn Lab 3, we will cover ethics and you will complete two activities within your groups.\n\n5.3.1 Information required for the lab activities\nResearch Question (this is also relevant for our FG questions)\nThis might look like: In qualitative research, we often ask about someone’s lived experience, or their motivations, or a belief they have. This is quite different to quantitative research.\nWhy might this be an issue: Qualitative research tends to be on topics where we ask people to be vulnerable and open themselves up to us as researchers. If we don’t frame this correctly, our interview schedule might contain questions that are inappropriate.\nData Collection\nThis might look like: Data collection is much less likely to be anonymous, as typically in-person or online focus groups or interviews are held. Samples are small, and participants may already be known to the researcher.\nWhy might this be an issue: There are possible issues of confidentiality, anonymity (these will be discussed further down) and bias. Our preconceptions might affect the way we frame the questions, how we interact with participants in the focus group, and how we interpret the data.\nRecording a focus group or interview\nThis might look like: The majority of the time, focus groups and interviews are recorded (either audio + video or audio only). This means that the ‘raw’ data - as it were - is identifiable. In contrast, data for quant studies are often collected anonymously.\nWhy might this be an issue: Data should always be kept safe and secure. However, with qualitative data, there is a real risk that individual people could be identified from a recording of them. This means that dealing with the recordings in a safe and secure way are of utmost importance, and that participants cannot be identified from transcripts.\nAnonymity\nThis might look like: In quantitative research, we tend to report summary statistics from groups, and therefore it’d be quite unusual to be able to identify a single participant from the data. With qualitative, it’s a bit different. We collect people’s words and experiences.\nWhy might this be an issue: It is easier to identify someone from the words they use, and the situations and circumstances they describe.\nConfidentiality\nThis might look like: In a focus group or interview, people might be very open with us, and tell us things about their life, and the lives of others.\nWhy might this be an issue: We have a duty of care to keep anything that comes out in a focus group/interview confidential (unless they disclose a crime or someone is judged to be at risk). It’s also vital that the rest of the focus group members keep the information confidential too.\n\n\n5.3.2 Lab 3 Activity 1: Mitatigation of the issues\nConsider the issues in the section above. In your groups, discuss each one in turn, thinking about the various steps that could be taken to reduce or remove these issues.\nThe issues that should be discussed are:\n\nResearch Question\nData Collection\nRecording a focus group or interview\nAnonymity\nConfidentiality\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Lab 3 Activity 2: Fictional focus group example\nAngela and John have run a focus group study to explore the experiences of UK university staff members during the pandemic. Below you will find their focus group schedule (the questions that they asked in the focus group), some correspondence they had about the study, and an excerpt of their data for the final write-up they are about to submit to a journal.\nIn your groups, try to identify what ethical issues there are, and how they could have been mitigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFocus group schedule\n\nWhat has been your experience with teaching during the pandemic?\nHow has this affected your personal life? What impact has your increased workload had on that?\nCan you describe some of the negative effects that this has had on your mental health? Prompt: What has been the worst thing about the pandemic for you?\nHow has your employer supported you during the pandemic?\nHow has your student contact differed from previous years?\n\nCorrespondence between the authors\nEmail 1:\n“Hi Angela,\nPlease see attached a Google Drive link to the raw data with focus group number 3. I’m just working on the anonymisation of FG4 on the library computers and will send it to you asap.\nCheers,\nJ”\nEmail 2:\n“Hi,\nThanks for the update! Actually my dissertation student is very interested in the topic so I thought they would help with the data analysis – can you share the raw data folder with 12345@student.gla.ac.uk also?\n-Angela”\nData Excerpt\nParticipant 1: “For me, as I’m the course lead for first-year philosophy, the workload was just simply too much to handle at times and I felt so alone.”\nParticipant 2: “Yeah, I agree, umm, it was really hard to just keep going with extra hours and that feeling of isolation”\nModerator: “What about you, Participant 3, how was your mental health affected negatively?”"

    "text": "5.7 Week 8 Lab 7: Evaluation in the Introduction and Discussion\nWe often ask for students to demonstrate evaluation in their writing, i.e. going beyond paraphrasing and descriptive writing. Essentially, we are looking for you to develop critical, evidence-based arguments that demonstrate your thinking.\nIn today’s lab, we are going to focus on how you might incorporate evaluation into your introduction and discussion. This will not only support you for the RM2 report, but also any other submissions you have (including your dissertation).\n\n5.7.1 Lab 7: Activity 1: Evaluation in Introductions\nThe purpose of your introduction is to provide a rationale for your study and answer the WHY question; why is your study worth doing? You want to sell your idea to the reader, using existing literature to show how you are building on the evidence that is there.\nIn Activity 1, read the following extracts from an introduction section. As a group, identify two aspects of evaluation that could be improved for this study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExtract 1 A study by Lane and Karin (2011) looked at zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students. The sample consisted of 25 participants (20 male and 5 female), recruited through convenience sampling. The study employed involved a survey comprising Likert-scale questions designed to measure participants’ self-assessed confidence in various survival skills. Additionally, participants were asked about their exposure to zombie-related media. The data were subjected to t-tests and regression analyses, and the authors’ found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse confidence was exposure to zombie-themed video games.\nExtract 2 It should be noted that the majority of studies on zombie apocalypse survival confidence have looked at samples that consist of mostly men (Lane & Karin, 2011 but see also Grimes & Dixon, 2019), and that previous samples have been small.\nExtract 3 To date, there has been only one qualitative study on the topic – Seok (2013) collected data through semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis and two themes, “Survival mode” and “Confidence through skills” were identified. This study looked at undergraduate students; there is no previous literature on postgraduate students’ perceptions of their apocalyptic confidence. Therefore, this qualitative study investigates the perceived confidence of postgraduate students in their abilities to survive a zombie apocalypse.\n\n\n\n\n5.7.2 Lab 7 Activity 2: Evaluation in Discussions\nThe purpose of your discussion is to summarise your results, contextualising them and situating them within the broader research context. As part of this process, it is important to consider the implications of your work, as well as the limitations and possible future directions. Discussions should be rooted in the evidence base, rather than based on personal opinion.\nIn Activity 2, read the following extracts from a discussion section. As a group, identify two aspects of evaluation that could be improved for this study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExtract 1 In this study, our investigation into the realm of confidence in preparing for the zombie apocalypse has revealed nuanced insights into individuals’ perceptions of their readiness for this so-far-unrealised scenario. Theme 1 was perceived media influence of feelings of preparedness. Here, we found that participants were more likely to feel prepared for the apocalypse when they watched zombie TV shows, which is in line with Lincoln and Reedus (2014). In Theme 2, we found that confidence was improved through perceived cooperation. This does not align with the most recent evidence, namely Morgan et al. (2023). These findings contribute to our understanding of how individuals navigate the complex interplay between personal beliefs, social interactions, and cultural representations when assessing their preparedness for extreme and unlikely events.\nExtract 2 There were a number of limitations in this study. Firstly, it is important to note that we were unable to generalise as there were only four participants in the study. Secondly, we are currently unable to tell whether confidence in zombie apocalypse survival translates to real-world skills. Finally, a limitation is that the questions did not consider how postgraduates might reduce their vulnerability to zombie attacks.\nExtract 3 This study offers insights into broader psychological phenomena and practical interventions. Governments around the world should take these findings and incorporate them into their disaster relief programs. This will enable policymakers and educators to further enhance individuals’ capacity to critically evaluate their preparedness, bridging the gap between perceived and actual abilities. Moreover, this research illuminates the ways in which fictional contexts can impact real-world perceptions, shedding light on cognitive biases and media’s potential to shape individuals’ self-assessment (Masterson, 2020). As the world faces increasingly diverse and unpredictable challenges, understanding how individuals approach threats from the zombie apocalypse helps foster a holistic approach to readiness in an ever-changing landscape."

Take some initial notes.\nIn your groups, code the data together. Note down anything that seems important and that you think encapsulates the data. Do you all agree on the codes or are there differences of opinion (remember it’s okay if you don’t all agree!)?\nPost the codes that your group has chosen on mentimeter\n\n\n5.8.1.1 Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExtract from E_NM4 Interview LGBT staff networks on UK Data Service\nRESEARCHER: So, how do you, how do you influence the organisation or how do you try to influence the organisation?\nCHARLES: Erm, the best person to go to in this organisation is, Lillian.\nRESEARCHER: Why’s that?\nCHARLES: Because, erm, she’ll give you a cut and dry answer, a yes or a no, erm, which is great, ’cause that’s what you want, you don’t want - I don’t want to go to someone that, if I go to Leo with it, generally it’s, what’s it gonna cost me? So, we have a budget of the group, but if it’s above the budget, then it’s, what’s it gonna cost, and then it’s always, there’s to-ing and fro-ing. Erm, if you go to the levels of management within the Trust, it always gets passed to other people, erm, one example of this is when we got the rainbow lanyard, erm, I, I said to Leo I wanted to get some, erm, we’d got them for getting in the Stonewall Top [ranking] the first year, so Leo agreed that he’d get them. He bought them and then, they came into the organisation and then, er, he said, oh, I’ve been speaking - he’d spoken to someone and they said, oh, you’re gonna have to get approval for them to go out and be used, so I think we were gonna put them out for LGBT History Month initially, but then they just sort of stayed. Leo had gone to HR and HR had said, oh, it’s the uniform policy, we don’t own that, you’ll have to go to ops, operations, so Leo went to operations and they said, oh, we don’t own that policy, it’ll be HR, you’ll have to go to them, so he went back to HR and HR said, well, we’re not comfortable saying it ’cause it’ll have an impact on ops and it’ll have an impact on this, so you’ll have to go to - and it just went round and round and round and for like, ten days, Leo was like, I don’t know where to go with it, I really don’t know what we do, no-one will take ownership. So, I, I picked one of the lanyards up, walked into Lillian’s office and said, do you like this, and she said, oh yeah, it’s great, can I have one, and I was like, yep, there we go. I was like, the problem is, we don’t know who owns the policy, who can we - and immediately she went, no, this is, this is what it’s for, this is what it is, put them out, and I think, you know, sometimes you just need someone who’s gonna make them decisions and be like, yes actually, we’ll support it.\nRESEARCHER: Yeah, yeah, no, I can see that, it’s kind of a straight answer and, you know, not being sent, you know, around into a circle. So, do you think, you know, when you’re thinking about what the network is doing now, do you think the network should be doing something else?\nCHARLES: Erm, I don’t think we have the capacity to do any more. I think, erm, it’d be great if we had enough people that, someone sat on all of the meetings and all of the groups within the Trust, it had a, a staff network member, erm, I’ve found that as the chair of the group, I get invited to a lot of these groups now, erm, and I do try and attend as many as I can, so I’m now on a health and wellbeing group and I’m on, erm, there’s another one I’m on, erm, but there’s other that like, the vehicle working group. I’d like to have someone sat on there so actually, we could influence it, actually could we have an LGBT sticker or can we have - do you know what I mean? Just, and it might be that they have no input for long periods, but there’s certain points where there might be that point where they can go, actually, that isn’t suitable for LGBT staff. Erm, the - but I’d need more people to step up, I’d need more support, erm, I know with, Camila, that’s just joined the group, erm, she’s really keen and she’s really showing promise now, which is great and sort of, can start seeing if she’ll attend some of these meetings. But I’m aware that her manager at the minute is really busy, and she’s getting lots of work and I’m not sure what the release is gonna be like for her to go and do this stuff, ’cause that’s the other issue."

Why?\nWhat have the authors done that makes the analysis better?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExtract 1 - from a study about the impact of the COVID pandemic\nSarah spoke of using her leisure time to plan and fantasise about her wedding:\n“it’s enough of a fantasy… it’s meant to be stressful, but it’s really just been fun. It’s like such a nice break from this humdrum life we’re living in right now” (Sarah: lines 459-461).\nOrganising a significant life event seems to be viewed as granting Sarah an escape from her current monotony. While she refers to it as a “fantasy”, potentially given uncertainty of the pandemic’s progression, she appears to perceive this as constructive and realistic for her future self. Alternately, Mandy’s leisure activity involved impossible daydreams:\n“I started daydreaming more ridiculous stuff… I know it’s never going to come true ’cause it’s not real, but it still entertains me” (Mandy: lines 443-444)\nWhile Mandy seems to be under no illusion that her daydreams are feasible, daydreaming impossible scenarios appears to provide more of a release than realistic situations that are subject to ever changing government regulations (e.g. travel bans) that may fall through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExtract 2 - from a study about social media use during the pandemic\nSome participants said it was difficult to fall asleep at night, including those who knew they should fall asleep but could not (“if I can’t stay up and can’t sleep”- Sarah), or participants subjectively thought that they did not need sleep or did not want to fall asleep (“I am not really able to sleep at night, or like, sleep isn’t really needed.” -Andrew)\nParticipants said that they used social media but that it was only positive at certain points:\nI feel like TikTok was fun in the first lockdown during the summer,’cause of all this summer content I guess, but after that it really went downhill. I don’t know like, OK personally I deleted all my apps about three weeks ago (John)\nJohn tells us here that he deleted all his apps, because they all went ‘downhill’. Tik Tok was helpful during the first lockdown, but not after it."

    "text": "6.1 Overview\n\n6.1.1 Project components\nThe qualitative project for RM2 has both group and individual components, and you will gain experience of designing a study, collecting data, being a participant in another group’s study, processing data, analysing data and writing your data up. All of these will build on the skills you learned in RM1, and will help prepare you to complete your own independent research project for your dissertation.\nThe qualitative project is broken down as follows:\n\nIn your groups, you will write a group proposal detailing the key literature for your project, as well as why it is important to conduct. This is a group assessment and is worth 30% of RM2.\nIn your groups, you will choose a topic, then finalise your research question. You will then choose questions you want to ask your participants. You will be allocated another group within your lab to act as your participants. In turn, you will be the participants for another group within your lab.\nIn your groups, you will hold a focus group, which will be held online using Microsoft Teams. You will then prepare your focus group transcript and anonymise it.\nFrom this point on, the remainder of the project is conducted individually, with you completing analysis and writing up your report (worth 50% of RM2) on your own. Please note that you MUST use thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2021) for your analysis. You are not allowed to use any other forms of analysis (e.g. IPA).\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Suggested Project timeline\nWe have developed a suggested timeline for the group and individual components. We advise that you use this to tackle the project throughout the semester, to avoid leaving yourself lots of work at the end. Do feel free to alter the suggested deadlines if you wish - the purpose is not to be restrictive, but instead to help you by detailing when you might want to complete tasks in order to pace yourself."

    "text": "6.2 Group Agreement and Task Allocation\nWe appreciate that group work can be challenging and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and rules that each of the group members is committed to. You will also be asked to allocate tasks, firstly for the group proposal (in Week 2, alongside the Group Agreement) and then for the Focus Group in Week 5.\n\n6.2.1 Group Agreement (Lab 2)\nPlease download the group agreement template. Then look at the list of potential items to include. These are provided within the template document itself, as well as below. As a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list. Then, allocate tasks for the group proposal and upload this document individually to moodle before your Week 3 lab. You will be asked, separately, to allocate tasks for the Focus Group in your Week 5 lab.\n\n6.2.1.1 Group Agreement Items (see Lab 2)\nHere is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the group agreement:\n\nWe all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group\nWe all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.\nWe all agree to respect each other’s individual ways of working and will discuss these openly as a group.\nWe all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.\nI agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support\nWe all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting, I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.\nWe agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.\nWe agree to establish the best method of communication for our group that’s inclusive and takes into account everybody’s individual needs.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Group Proposal Task Allocation (see Lab 2)\nPlease note that this is a suggested list of tasks to get you started. You may find that there are additional tasks you allocate within your group as part of the project. You may have one person on a particular task, with multiple people on others. There is no one correct way to do this, and it is fine if the task allocation changes at a later date. It is intended to be a live document that you update as you progress with the group project.\n\n6.2.2.1 Group Proposal Items\nPrep work\n\nFinalise your group agreement an submit to Moodle individually (EVERYBODY)\nIdentify, share and read studies related to your topic and qualitative/focus group methodology (EVERYBODY)\nDevelop and finalise your research question (EVERYBODY)\nIdentify which course materials to use for support for each section\n\nLead writing\n\nSummarise studies on the background of your RQ\nWrite section 1 (background to topic)\nRead BPS code of ethics and identify potential issues for the study\nDiscuss the justification for your study and its methodology (EVERYBODY)\nDraft section 2A (why use qualitative methods for this particular topic)\nDraft section 2B (why Focus Groups)\nDraft section 2C (why this specific sample)\nDraft section 3 (ethics)\n\nEditing and reviewing\n\nEdit the group proposal to make it into a cohesive piece\nFormatting and referencing (make consistent)\nCheck that in-text citations and reference list match\nAgree on the final piece together (read the final version and agrees to it) (EVERYBODY)\nFinal proofread for spelling and grammar\n\nAdmin\n\nCreate a shared citation library\nSet up a Teams chat/channel and a shared oneDrive folder for your group\nMake sure everybody has access and editing rights to shared documents\nKeeping track of group communication (minutes of meetings, to-do lists etc)\nGroup management (coordination of meetings, scheduling)\nDraft and Final Proposal submission\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Focus Group Task Allocation (see Lab 5)\nIn lab 5, we will ask you to allocate tasks for running the focus group.

    "section": "6.3 Topic Guide",
    "text": "6.3 Topic Guide\nAs part of your qualitative project, you will be expected to write a review of the literature as part of your Introduction section. It is important that the Introduction has a clear rationale which supports your chosen research question.\nWhat follows here is an outline of various topics you should consider when you develop your research question, and which form the starting point for you project.\nOne of the aims of qualitative research is to be critical of some of the assumptions made by mainstream quantitative studies and to highlight their limitations. In highlighting limitations, you should aim to develop research questions that address weaknesses identified and provide a rationale for using a focus group methodology.\nYou should use this topic guide to help you plan your study, and support you with your research questions and rationale assignment. However, you are in no way expected to read everything in the reference section (or even within each topic). These references are provided purely to give you a starting point, and you are encouraged to go beyond the scope of what is provided here.\nAfter the four topics have been presented, we will provide some information about your rationale, and also some key steps for moving forward.\nThree research topics:\n\nNature access, nature connectedness and wellbeing\nStudents and mental health\nBelonging at University\n\n\n6.3.1 Topic 1: Nature access, nature connectedness and wellbeing\nPhilosophers, writers, environmentalists and ecologists have long argued that humans derive physiological and psychological benefits from spending time in natural environments, such as forests, beaches or mountains (Wilson, 1984). Wilson argued for a strong evolutionary basis for this effect: our species had spent hundreds of thousands of years (nearly all of its evolutionary history) living and thriving within natural environments, humans should have a deep rooted connection with nature that is beneficial to us. Since everyday survival depended on activities such as finding food, water or firewood, and avoiding predators, all of which required humans to be attentive and responsive to any cues the environment might offer, individuals who were more connected with nature would have had an important advantage in that context.\nOver half of the world’s population lives in an urban, rather than rural, environment and this is expected to increase to 68% by 2050 (United Nations, 2018; World Health Organization, 2011). In Canada, more than 80% of people live in urban areas, and Canadians spend almost 90% of their time indoors (Howell & Passmore, 2013). In a survey of 1,000 United Kingdom citizens, only 55% of those over the age of 35, and 37% of those under the age of 35, reported feeling “connected to the natural world” (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, 2010). Both time-criterion and nature- knowledge-criterion studies show that nature-based recreation is on the decline in many countries (Charles & Louv, 2009).\nAt the same time, research into nature connectedness shows that engaging with natural environments can have beneficial effects on a wide range of psychological and physiological aspects of wellbeing (Burns, 2005; White et al., 2019), and that these effects can be seen even with relatively minor interventions (Berto, 2005). In the last 30 years, environmental and positive psychologists have gathered considerable evidence that supports the idea that humans benefit from contact with nature ( Berto, 2014; Howell & Passmore, 2013), and that green space can provide a buffer against the negative health impact of stressful life events (van den Berg et al., 2010). The available research investigates a wide range of benefits, from physical health and longevity to happiness, cognitive focus and attentional capacity, and has been done using a wide variety of methods. Considering the preponderance of stress and mental health problems facing the developed world (Gullone, 2000; WHO, 2022), studying the effects of nature is an important task for psychologists. On a more personally relevant note, understanding the effects of green spaces and animals on wellbeing can give you another set of tools that can be used to enhance your own wellbeing and help cope with the stress of university life.\nNature affiliation and access to nature\nThere are two important related concepts in nature connectedness literature.\nAccess to nature means the extent to which a person is in contact with nature, which can be measured objectively by logging location or looking at area maps. A lot of epidemiological studies use objective measures of green space access to see if it affects population health, while experimental studies can use nature contact interventions to see how people respond.\nNature connectedness/affiliation trait: this means the personal characteristics that make a person appreciate nature more and is usually measured with self-report questionnaires. It has been defined as “individuals’ experiential sense of oneness with the natural world” (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Smaller studies often look at how the trait of nature connectedness interacts with nature access to predict various aspects of wellbeing.\nState of nature connectedness: this means the current, changing relationship with nature, something that is “dynamic, changing from day to day and moment to moment as a function of experiences with nature” (Weinstein, Przybylski, & Ryan, 2009).\nResearch on effects of nature access and connectedness\nLarge scale epidemiological research\nOne of the possible ways of investigating nature connectedness is by comparing similar populations with varying degrees of access to natural environments. One of such studies analysed five year survival rates for over 3000 Tokyo seniors, born between 1903 and 1918 (Takano, Nakamura, & Watanabe, 2002) and found that longevity was greater among senior citizens living in areas with walkable green spaces. Variables such as age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, and baseline physical ability were controlled. Having walkable green streets and spaces near the seniors’ residences showed significant predictive value for elderly survival over the 5 years of the study.\nIn Holland, researchers reviewed records for 250,782 citizens being treated by 104 general practitioners and confirmed a robust relationship between green spaces and health (Maas, Verheij, Groenewegen, de Vries, & Spreeuwenberg, 2006). The paper reported that “health differences in residents of urban and rural municipalities are to a large extent explained by the amount of green space” in the individuals’ direct living environment (p. 591). Additionally, the relation between green space and health was found to be stronger for lower socioeconomic groups and that elderly, youth, and secondary educated people in large cities seemed to benefit more from presence of green areas in their living environment than other groups.\nFinally, University of Glasgow researchers (Mitchell & Popham, 2008) looked at income-related health inequality within the English population below the retirement age, obtaining anonymised data from the Office for National Statistics and amassing data from over 40 million people. They found that populations living in the greenest environments also had lowest levels of health inequality related to income deprivation and had lower all-cause and circulatory mortality rates.\nOverall, the available large scale epidemiological research shows a clear association between having access to green spaces in urban areas or living in a natural setting and various subjective and objective health outcomes. These associations remain relevant when controlling for education and income, and in fact become stronger for lower levels of socioeconomic status. This has implications for supporting student mental health in higher education (Hughes & Spanner, 2019), with universities recognising the impact of the campus environment and green space as part of a stepped approach to supporting student mental health and wellbeing (Universities UK, 2020).\nCorrelational research\nThere are numerous correlational studies that look at how nature access and nature affiliation affect different aspects of wellbeing. The studies that established the three measures of nature affiliation found significant correlations between their scales and life satisfaction (Mayer & Frantz, 2004), positive affect (Mayer et al., 2009) and autonomy, positive affect and personal growth (Nisbet, Zelenski, & Murphy, 2011). Herzog & Strevey (2008) also showed that undergraduate students’ self-reported degree of contact with nature correlated with positive affect and personal growth.\nExperimental research\nExperimental research on nature access and connectedness is focused on presenting participants with nature-related interventions and observing whether these had a positive effect on a variety of measures of health and wellbeing. Mayer et al. (2009) carried out three experiments manipulating exposure to nature - spending 15 min in either a nature park or in an urban setting, watching a 10-min video clip of nature or urban setting and engaging in a nature walk or to watch a video clip of the same walk. In all three of these studies, the nature condition had no effect on negative affect, but participants’ positive affect was boosted compared to those in the control conditions. Berman, Jonides, & Kaplan (2008) randomly assigned undergraduate students to spend 50 min walking in either a park or an urban setting, and discovered that only the nature walk resulted in a mood increase. Weinstein et al. (2009) carried out 4 experiments looking at whether exposure to nature affected how we value intrinsic aspirations, which are goals that in themselves satisfy basic psychological needs (such as personal growth, intimacy, community) and extrinsic aspirations, which are pursued to derive rewards or positive regard from others (e.g., money, image, fame). In all four studies, participants exposed to nature endorsed more intrinsic and less extrinsic values, which is in turn related to helpfulness in social situations, and feelings of community cohesion.\nQualitative approach\nDespite a richness of quantitative studies on this topic, very few qualitative enquiries have been published to date. Combined with the relative rarity of qualitative approaches to topics not immediately neighbouring social psychology, this means that there is a lot of scope for qualitative research within positive psychology, and the field of nature connectedness in particular.\nOne interesting mixed methods study has been done on students using a green prescription activity of taking a walk in nature, facilitated by a mobile phone app (Boyd, 2022). The intervention and students’ experience of engaging with the natural environment were discussed in focus groups and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Key themes included students’ experience of and the design of university spaces, a desire for safe and sociable spaces, nature as a place of shelter from the city, and requests for more natural and wild landscapes. Interestingly, cultural and social factors, such as working hours and upbringing influenced students’ seeking out opportunities to interact with green spaces while on campus.\nAnother mixed methods study on the wellbeing of allotment gardeners (Webber, Hinds, & Camic, 2015) found that the gardeners’ subjective well-being and quality of life were higher than population means would suggest, and that this was related to the time they spent in their allotments and how connected to nature they felt. Analysis of open ended survey responses indicated 4 main themes in the data: having own space, feeling connectedness, benefits to physical health and engaging in meaningful activity. This study set forth with a very broad qualitative research question, and only had a limited form of data to work with, so the themes are very general.\nA fully qualitative study was carried out on Toronto and Chicago office workers’ perceptions of green roof spaces (Loder, 2014). Loder carried out phenomenological, social constructionist analysis of semi-structured interviews, which covered constructs such as attitudes to nature and green roofs in particular, health and work environment. The analysis uncovered five themes: aesthetics of roof spaces, surprise and fascination with the greens spaces, symbolism of urban green spaces and the relationship between green roofs and well-being.\n\n6.3.1.1 Nature and wellbeing: Potential project topics\n\nExperience of nature while studying or traveling abroad. How do we engage with nature when we’re not in our usual place of stay, and how does it affect our wellbeing?\nAccounts of practice: How do people living in cities engage with green spaces?\nWhat perceived benefits do the green spaces around the University campus bring?\nHow can university green spaces be designed as a wellbeing resource for students?\n\nThese are just a few example questions. You are encouraged to develop these ideas or come up with new questions based on your reading.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Topic 2: Students and mental health\nThere has been increasing concern about the mental health of students at university. In a survey of over 2,000 students, suicide ideation was reported by 2%. Anxiety and depression symptoms were also commonly reported (Eisenberg et al., 2007). Another study conducted over two time points found that mental health problems are persistent and that many people do not seek the help they need (Zivin et al., 2009).\nInterestingly, it has been shown that sleep disturbances in students, when treated, can also improve mental health status (Freeman et al., 2015), suggesting an intimate link between sleep and mental health. Guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as to how much sleep is recommended across different age groups. For teenagers aged 13-18 , 8-10 hours are recommended, for adults (aged 18-60), 7 hours or more on a regular basis is recommended for optimal mental and physical health (Badr et al., 2015). Indeed, getting an adequate amount of sleep is associated with lower anxiety, tension, depression and higher satisfaction with life (Pilcher & Walters, 1997). The topic of student’s mental health has received media attention recently with articles suggesting that there is a “mental health crisis” (Thomas, 2018).\nStudents and seeking support\nUniversities provide support for students, and this support maybe come in many forms, from free counselling services to well-being advisors (Raunic & Xenos, 2008).\nIn one study, it was reported that only 3% of students used their university counselling service, and only 5% of those who were characterised as vulnerable based on questionnaire scores, used the services (Cooke et al., 2006). This suggests that the majority of students did not make use of services available.\nThere are many reasons why students may not choose to seek help, including being unaware of services, low socio-economic status, being from an Asian background, embarrassment about having to seek help and scepticism about the services (Eisenberg et al., 2007; Gulliver et al., 2010).\nAnother issue around seeking support is that many who do chose to get help, have to wait long periods for appointments (Mowbray et al., 2006). In a recent article reported in the Independent, a waiting time of 4 months was cited for some universities. These delays to support, can lead to emergence of mental health crises situations. Unfortunately, in this the University of Glasgow had one of the longest wait times for counselling (Buchan, 2018).\n\n6.3.2.1 Students and mental health: Potential project topics\n\nWhat are student perceptions of the mental health services provided by Universities?\nWhat are student’s views on how universities can support students and their mental health needs?\n\nThese are just two example questions. You are encouraged to develop these ideas or come up with new questions based on your reading.\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Topic 3: Belonging at University\nThere is extensive evidence that feeling a sense of belonging (also sometimes referred to as identifying with a group) is considered to be a basic psychological need (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Feeling like we belong can foster a sense of personal control (Greenaway et al, 2015), increase meaning and purpose in life (Haslam et al., 2018) protect from existential anxiety (Sani, Herrera & Bowe, 2009), and promote reciprocal support (Levine, Prosser, Evans, & Reicher, 2005).\nFurthermore, research has found a robust link between feeling like you belong to a range of different social groups (including family, University, workplace, and friend groups) and positive psychological outcomes. These outcomes include a degree of protection from depression (Cruwys et al., 2014; Sani et al. 2012), anxiety (Sani et al., 2012; Wakefield et al., 2013), post-traumatic stress (Swartzman et al., 2016), paranoia (Sani et al.,, 2017; Greenaway et al., 2018), and cognitive decline (Haslam et al., 2010).\nThinking specifically about University, having a sense of belonging is associated with academic success and motivation (Freeman et al., 2007). There is also evidence that it is related to students’ wellbeing, with higher levels of postive emotions, self-worth and social acceptance being linked with feelings of belonging to University (Pittman and Richmond, 2007; Wilson et al., 2015). Students who do not feel like they connect with their University may be more likely to disengage, increasing the likelihood of considering leaving university without completing (Pedler et al., 2022).\nGiven these findings, it is important to understand what can help facilitate a sense of belonging at University, and what barriers might be in place to reduce the likelihood of feeling like you belong.\nFacilitating a sense of belonging for students\nThere has been a recent focus on how Universities can develop a sense of belonging for their students, e.g, Samura (2022) published an article in The Conversation discussing how we can meaningfully think about belonging at University. WONKHE (an organisation related to debate in Higher Education) and Pearson (an academic publisher) published a (non-peer-reviewed) report exploring ways in which institutions can help students develop a sense of belonging. They found that there were four key areas that were important: connection (e.g. developing friendships and peer connections), inclusion (e.g. diverse, inclusive content), support (e.g. ability to access appropriate support at the point of needing it) and autonomy (e.g. being able to contribute to the wider university experience) (Blake et al., 2022).\nPedler et al. (2022) found that there are positive correlations between belonging, motivation and enjoyment at University. It also seems to be the case that a sense of belonging is related to specific actions/behaviours that support achievement in students (Gillen-O’Neel, 2021). Many of the studies in this area have looked at these through a quantitative lens, with fewer delving into why these relationships might occur, or why they might be important to students.\n\n6.3.3.1 Belonging at University: potential project questions\n\nWhat can Universities do to help facilitate a sense of belonging for their postgraduate students?\nWhat do students perceive as barriers to a feeling of belonging at University?\nWhat can postgraduate Psychology Conversion course students do to facilitate a sense of belonging to their University/programme?\n\nThese are just a few example questions. You are encouraged to develop these ideas or come up with new ideas based on your reading.\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Rationale for using qualitative methodologies\nIn research methodology “fitting the approach to the research purposes is the critical issue” (Rossi, Lipsey, & Freeman, 2003), therefore all decisions about methodology have to be made after careful consideration about their fitness for purpose. Since qualitative approaches to research design are suited to uncovering new ideas and exploring areas that have not been investigated before (Marshall & Rossman, 2014) your projects will use qualitative methods.\nThe main purpose of a focus group is to draw upon the range of respondents’ attitudes and feelings; this could not be done using other methods such as interviews or observations. Compared to individual interviews, which aim to obtain individual attitudes and feelings, focus groups can be used to obtain a group consensus. More data can be collected in a shorter period of time.\nWhen using qualitative approaches their emphasis is on describing a meaningful social world (Silverman, 2015). Quantitative and qualitative approaches produce different, but not incompatible data. Therefore, using qualitative methods does not detract from what already exists within the quantitative literature.\nIndeed, both qualitative and quantitative approaches can produce different data, which together explores the phenomenon. Let’s think about it using a different example to those in the topics above. For example, past research in the area of poor quality sleep suggests that whie sleep quality is accepted as a clinical construct, it represents a complex phenomenon that is difficult to measure and define. It could be argued that “sleep quality” can be measured could contain quantitative aspects- for example duration of time sleeping or number of arousals. However, there are also more subjective aspects to sleep too, such as restfulness.\n\n\n6.3.5 Overall guidance and next steps\nSome of the topics may be sensitive for people, and therefore it is important to not be overly direct and also to be ethical in the way you ask questions. If you are asking about mental health, for example, don’t ask your participants about their own mental health. Remember that you will be working with your peers, and they will be known to you. Instead, ask about their opinions to do with mental health.\nWhen designing questions, you can refer to chapter 3 as cited in Braun and Clarke (Braun & Clarke, 2013), as well as guidance cited in Agee (2009). In terms of next steps, you need to agree on a topic area, and potential research questions. Complete your summative assignment for the Group Proposal (Research Question and Rationale) by the due date.\n\nAcknowledgments\nTopic 1: Maxine Swingler and Eva Murzyn Topic 2: Ashley Robertson Topic 3: Ashley Robertson\n\n\n\n6.3.6 References (sorted by topic)\n\n6.3.6.1 Topic 1: Green Spaces\nBerman, M.

    "section": "\n7.1 Preparation for collecting data",
    "text": "7.1 Preparation for collecting data\n\n7.1.1 Planning the focus group\nWe suggest scheduling your focus group for Week 8.\nTwo people should run the focus group - one person should act as the facilitator and the other person should act as the note-taker. This is the minimum required to run the focus group.\nIf other members of your group would like to come along to watch, this is okay (but please ask your participants if they are comfortable with this). If additional members do join to observe, they should not participate in the group, and should have their microphones and camera’s turned off so as not to interfere with the process.\nWe anticipate focus groups will be around 30-45 minutes (not including ice-breaker and setting things up at the start) - yours may be shorter or longer than this, but please discuss with your participants if you are planning a longer focus group, and ask them if they’d be comfortable with extending it.\nEthics information and the finalised version of the focus group schedule (just the main questions, not the probes/prompts) must be sent to your focus group members in advance, and they must return signed consent forms to you. Keep these safe - they do not need to be passed on to the Course Leads.\nPlease use the checklist and allocation activities that were given to you to complete in the Week 5 lab.\n\n7.1.2 Ethics\nPlease adapt the Information Sheet and Consent form for your focus group. These do not need to be submitted for formative assessment. There are only a few, minor, sections in each form that need adapted in order to make them specific for your project.\nYou must give everyone participating in the group the Information sheet and consent form before the focus group takes place. Completed consent forms should be returned to the group hosting the focus group before the group commences. These must be destroyed after hand-in of the project.\nPlan what the best approach for this will be among your group, and agree who will be responsible for this.\nRemember that everyone (both those participating and running) the focus group have a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the discussion.\n\n7.1.3 Collecting demographics\nIt might be a good idea to collect demographics information - discuss with your group what might be best to collect. Remember to only collect what you need to help the reader understand the context of your focus group. Demographics information must be collected using Microsoft Forms.\nSign into Microsoft forms and click new quiz\n\n\n\n\nHow to make a new quiz\n\n\n\nThen click add new question and you will be able to select the type of question. There are a number of options; it’s most likely that choice (multiple choice) or text (open textbox) will be what you will use.\n\n\n\n\nAdding questions\n\n\n\nYour first question should ask for the identifier. When you give the participants the consent form, there should be a number that you assign to them. This helps you link up the person and the demographics but without asking them to provide their name.\n\n\n\n\nLinking demographics\n\n\n\nFrom here, you can add in the agreed questions from your group.\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to note:\n\n\nPlease do not collect names automatically - this can be turned off by going to the three dots to the right of Share (at the top right), then Settings, then untick ‘record name’ You will see your responses come in via the ‘responses’ tab. These can be downloaded in excel format To share, click share and then you can copy a link that you can send out to your participants.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Focus group structure\nThere are a number of stages to a focus group, and it’s not always exactly the same, but we would advise the following structure for your focus group:\nStage 1: Setting the scene. The topic of the project should be introduced by the facilitator, and everyone agrees to take part. It must be made clear to the people in your focus group a) that they do not have to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable with, b) highlight that the session will be recorded, and they have a choice to have their camera on or off, but that the mic must be used, c) what will happen with the recordings (i.e. that they will be kept safe on University-approved servers and the transcript anonymised), d) that everyone has a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the topics discussed in the group and e) that they are free to leave the session at any time. Run through the Information Sheet and Consent Form here, and discuss any ground rules you have. I would also raise the point here that there are a few questions to get through, and therefore you might have to step in to help manage time.\nStage 2: Recording. Remember to press record!! This is very important.\nStage 3: Introductions. Go around the ‘table’ and ask everyone to introduce themselves. Start with yourself and the note-taker first. Everyone should state their first name clearly.\nStage 4: Ice-breaker. Ask a warm-up question or ice-breaker. The aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking.\nStage 5: Discussion. This is where you ask your main questions, and follow-up questions. It is a good idea to prepare around five or six main questions, and perhaps highlight three or four that are most important to focus on. The discussion may follow a different order to that on the focus group schedule - this is fine.\nStage 6: Facilitating the discussion. The facilitator should be prepared to help steer conversation back on track, and balance discussion so that everyone gets a chance to contribute. Have a few specific prompts that relate to each question and/or some general prompts to keep the discussion flowing. What are you going to do if no-one participates? Or if one person is contributing? For example… “has anyone else had a similar experience? ..Does anyone have a different view?” At the same time be ethical and avoid targeting people. Give participants the opportunity to describe their interpretations and take ownership. E.g., “How would…make you feel”, “Have you ever noticed that…” “Think back to when…”, “What was most important to you about…?”\nStage 7: Ending the discussion. It’s good to end the discussion by going round the group and asking each participant if they have anything they want to add to the discussion/sum up their thoughts on what was discussed.Remember to allow focus group members the chance to confirm/withdraw consent for their anonymised contributions to be used. Also remind them that the discussion cannot be reproduced/recorded for any other purpose than for the qualitative report.\nPlease discuss some ‘ground rules’ at the start with the group, and also go through the Information Sheet and consent form at the start, to ensure everyone is aware of their responsibilities.\n\n7.1.5 Facilitation and note-taking\n\n7.1.5.1 Facilitation/moderation\nThe facilitator (sometimes also known as the moderator) will be the person taking the lead during the focus group. They will be the one asking the questions of the participants, and the one facilitating the discussion. As you are aiming to mimic a naturalistic conversation, you have to build rapport. Ensure you allow everyone time to introduce themselves, and contribute to the ice-breaking phase by saying a bit about yourself.\nA good interviewer shares the perspective of the people they are talking to throughout the focus group. The interviewer should not be listening out for good quotes and should not be thinking about what to analyse. The role of the interviewer is to listen to the participants, and understand their points of view.\n\n7.1.5.2 Note-taking\nIt is a good idea to have a note-taker there. Hopefully there will be no IT issues that mean that the recording doesn’t work! Therefore, the note-taker should remind the facilitator about recording if required, and note down any impressions/initial thoughts around themes/good quotes. This can be helpful when you come to analysis. Was anything unexpected? Did participants focus on a particular aspect of a question over others? Was there anything that the discussion kept coming back to? Also, you could note down how well the questions worked - were there any that participants didn’t understand?\n\n7.1.5.3 Facilitation: how to manage the group\nThere is likely to be variety in the class in terms of how to manage group dynamics in your focus group. Here, we have some tips for those who might find them useful.\nBalance contributions from those who are quieter and those who are more dominant in a group situation\n\nThe ice-breaker/easy opening questions are perhaps most important for quieter members of the group, to help make them feel more comfortable.\nIt might be a good idea to use the ‘Raise hand’ feature on Teams - this would allow quieter members to show that they want to contribute, but without trying to gauge when to jump in the conversation. You can then take points in order of when they raised their hands.\nIf some people have contributed to part of the discussion and others haven’t, open it up to the rest by asking if anyone who hasn’t responded yet has anything to add. However, don’t put people on the spot by asking them directly.\n\nIf the discussion is stuck on one topic\n\nRemind the members of the group that there are a number of different questions to explore, and that you are mindful of time, so it might be best to leave that topic for now, and you can return if there’s time at the end.\n\nIf you are unsure what someone meant\n\nSeek clarity during the focus group if you are unsure about what a participant meant during the discussion.\n\n7.1.6 Practical considerations\nYou don’t have much control of the environment, as we are all doing our focus groups online using Microsoft Teams. It is not possible to do them in person due to logistical restraints (recording equipment and booking space) and you cannot use platforms other than Microsoft Teams due to logistics (Zoom is limited to 40 mins) as well as University requirements around GDPR.\nYou will be recording the visual and audio content of this focus group. Practice using the Teams environment with the rest of your group in advance. See this video for help.\nPlease press record before you start the focus group! You do not want to end the focus group and find out that you didn’t press the right button and the whole thing is gone. Just in case, a member of the group could be taking notes. This should never be the interviewer, as this would distract them from their task of understanding what is being said.\nAfter the focus group, consider the following questions:\n\nDo you think your research question has been answered? If not, why not?\nIf participants went off-track, is that because there was a flaw in your questions, or because they hit on a topic that was more interesting to them?\n\nEither way, you can write up a really strong project by being reflexive and considering what you could do differently in future.\n\n7.1.6.1 Setting up and recording the online focus group\n\nPilot the focus group schedule on friends first\nAre there any questions that need refined?\nDo a test recording beforehand using Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Stream (transcription software). This should be done early enough that you can contact one of the Course Leads if there are any issues.\nSee the 15 minute video here for how to set up and record a Teams meeting and access the transcript.\nDid everything work okay in the test? Is there anything you are uncertain of? If there were any issues during the test (e.g. if you weren’t able to access Stream), contact the Course Leads ASAP and let them know.\n\n7.1.6.2 Downloading the transcript\nYou can access the transcript on the teams chat that has been set up automatically when you record. Stream. You can either download it as a word doc or vtt text file.\nMethod 1: Go to the chat for your recording and then select the three dots next to ‘transcript’. You can choose to download the transcript either as a word doc or a vtt. We recommend the word doc if it’s available, but if not then the vtt will be fine.\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the data method 1\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Click the link for the video in the chat. It might only be the person who recorded it who has access automatically, or it might be everyone in the chat. Click on ‘Transcription’. Please note that it will only be the .vtt file you get using this method.\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the data method 2\n\n\n\nMethod 3: If you log onto Stream directly, you can access all recordings - click on the relevant one and then follow the steps above (in Method 2) to access the transcript\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the data method 3\n\n\n\n\n7.1.6.3 GDPR compliance\nGDPR: general data protection regulation. It is the most up to date data protection law.\nFor your project it is important that:\n\nData will be retained until after completion of the project on a password-protected encrypted drive and a secure database accessible only to the research team.\nAfter this period (end of academic year 2020-21), any paper documents will be shredded and disposed and electronic files will be deleted.\n\nStoring and Accessing Data Securely\n\nMake a copy of the recording from Stream onto a secure file sharing network (i.e. One Drive via Office 365).\nDelete the recording from Stream as soon as you have done this (double-/triple-check you have saved the recording properly beforehand!).\nMake sure that you only share the anonymised transcript with the group via One Drive.\n\nDo not share via social media, Google Drive or personal email which is not secure.\nSee the University guidelines on handling confidential data\n\n7.1.7 Processing data: Transcribing\nTranscribing is where you take an audio recording and make a version of this that is written down. This is then what we use as our data when we analyse qualitative research (on the whole, anyway!).\n\n7.1.7.1 Overview of transcribing for your project\nFor your RM2 project, you will be recording your groups online. This means that it should be possible to use the auto-generated transcript. The auto-generated transcript normally take a little while longer to generate than the recording - it is normal for it to take up to 24h to arrive. If you use the auto-generated transcript, then it should be relatively easy to obtain a transcript for the whole focus group.\nIf the auto-generated transcript does not work for any reason, then it is fine to just transcribe a 10 minute portion of the focus group from the recording by hand. Ideally, this should be a whole 10 mins (e.g. not 2 mins at the start, 5 in the middle and 3 at the end).\nPlease see the steps outlined in ‘Setting up and recording the online focus group’ (part of ‘Practical considerations’ for information about how to download your transcript.\nThis section will instead contain details of how you should move the content over from the autogenerated text file to the transcript, and what we’d typically expect to see.\n\n7.1.7.2 Transcribing and editing your transcript\nHere is an example of a template that you might find useful. You are not required to use this, but you are welcome to do so.You will have to download your own copy as you will not be able to edit the original.\nAt the top, complete the details of all those who attended the focus group. We’ll anonymise later, as it’s easier to do this all at once rather than as we go along.\nIt’s advisable to have a time stamp regularly (I normally do one per minute), so that I can easily find the right part in the original recording if I have to. However, if you do not want to put this in, you do not need to. There are line numbers in the template - it is good practice to include these, but it can be time-consuming to do so. If you would prefer to remove the line number column, this is okay.\nWith each new speaker, take a new line in the table. You will need to add more lines to the table - do this by inserting rows at the bottom. Only move to a new cell with each new speaker.\nThe next step is to go through the transcript and compare it to the recording. Are there any parts that the auto-gen transcript that are incorrect? Replace these in the transcript with what should be the case.\n\n7.1.8 Processing data: Pseudonymisation\nStep 1: Decide in your groups what data needs to be removed or replaced in order to ensure the participants are not identifiable. Some examples:\n\nSpeaker names?\nNames mentioned within the transcript?\nLocations?\nJob titles?\nUnusual situations (e.g. I had a participant who had an experience that they spoke about and had been in the newspapers…we had to change the details of this to ensure it was anonymous).\n\nStep 2: Are you going to remove the information completely or replace it?\nIf we had a transcript with the following information:\n“So, yeah, John and I went to uni together in Leeds, and we met up with Sandy for the first time there. All three of us went a trip to Broughty Ferry.”\nOption 1: We have the option of replacing:\n“So, yeah, Mike and I went to uni together in Manchester, and we met up with Karen for the first time there. All three of us went a trip to Montrose.”\nIf you replace, keep it consistent throughout the transcript (e.g. every time John is mentioned, it should be replaced with Mike; each time Leeds is mentioned, it should be replaced with Manchester).\nThe easiest thing to do is have a key (this is just a document where you have noted what all the replacements are) - in this, just state what you are using for each unique replacement. Once you’ve replaced everything that needs replaced, you can delete the key.\nYou should have a clear rationale for what you are replacing, and should be upfront with the reader in your methods section if you choose this.\nOption 2: We have the option of redacting:\n“So, yeah, (brother) and I went to uni together in (city in England), and we met up with (friend) for the first time there. All three of us went a trip to (small town in Scotland).”\nYou should always replace the speaker names (i.e. denoting who is speaking in the transcript), but you can redact the actual words spoken if you choose.\nStep 3: Discuss in your group, and arrange which approach you want to take. Decide who is going to anonymise the transcript."

    "text": "7.3 How to structure your focus group schedule\nPreparation is essential for the focus group process to run smoothly. This includes taking the time to think about and try out your focus group schedule.\nAt this stage we are looking for an example of an icebreaker, and the main questions you want to ask your participants (with prompts/probes, if appropriate). You should also have an exit/wrap up question. - Prompts are additional questions to remind your participants of the key points – you would only need to use these if they don’t answer part of the question in their answer. - Probes are supplementary questions that you can ask to get more information: e.g. to clarify or justify something, or to give an example.\nYou should choose around five to six main questions for your focus group from the question bank. If you need to alter these slightly so that they make sense, this is fine. However, if you modify them significantly or you make up new questions, you must go to your tutor’s office hours to discuss your questions with them before you use them in your focus group.\n\n7.3.1 Warm up Question\nStart off with a warm up question. The aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking. In other focus groups, students have asked people to describe the place they would most like to visit or what their favourite meal from their home country is. It should be a question that generates discussion and is something that is easy to answer.\n\n7.3.2 Main Focus Group Questions\nChoose 5-6 questions on your topic from the list in the question bank. You may need to modify these slightly to get them to work for your topic. Remember that, if you need to make a new question up, you can do so. However, you will need to run it past your tutor to make sure it is appropriate.\nBear in mind that you may not cover all aspects of your research question in one focus group - the discussion may wander off track or focus on one aspect. Consider which part of the research question you think is most important to get people to answer. Start with this and be prepared to come back to it at the end if you need to. If you have more sensitive questions in your research schedule, they should be included later on, so people answer them when they are more comfortable.\nSome tips for developing questions: - Avoid asking questions that ask two or three things in one sentence (e.g., about behaviour and impact on mood). Break it down into simpler questions. - Try to avoid asking questions that can be answered yes/no, unless you then follow up with a question opening things up. Although yes/no questions are useful for gathering information, they are not helpful for generating a discussion. Your questions should be open. - Add in probes/prompts to elicit further information if required. - Remember to ask people about their perspectives/perceptions/experiences/opinions/views\n\n7.3.3 Closing question\nThe aim here is to give people an opportunity to add anything that might have been missed in the discussion/to wrap things up. Examples might be ‘Does anyone have anything else that they would like to add before we finish the focus group?’ or ‘Thank you for your participation – is there anything that anyone would like to add before we wrap things up?’"

This means reading while searching for meanings and patterns\nNote down anything of interest that comes up, either in a particular part of a transcript or thinking about the overall dataset\n\nPractical steps:\nRead through your transcript and take notes and/or make comments in the margins. Generate a list of ideas: what is interesting about the discussion? Are there any contradictions that you spot? What patterns do you observe?\n\n8.2.2 Phase 2: Generating initial codes (p.59)\n\nCodes identify a feature of the data that seems interesting\nThe process of coding involves going through the transcript and thinking about the data, and picking out what seems interesting/important.\nTry to apply short, specific, labels to each part of the transcript as you go through it.\nCoded data is specific (themes, which come later, are broad) - you will likely end up with quite a lot of different codes.\nCode for as many patterns as you can at this point - it won’t all make it to the next stage, but it’s good if you pick up as much as you can at this stage.\n\nPractical steps:\nInsert labels beside quotes - what is interesting about the quote? What does it tell us in relation to your research question?\n\n8.2.3 How to actually do the coding (logistically)?\nThere are many different ways to approach this - find the way that works for you! There are also different software to conduct thematic analysis (such as NVivo); you are welcome to use these if you wish, but due to the introductory nature of this course we don’t have guidance for using them, so you need to do learn it independently, should you want to use one.\nOption 1: Hand-coding\n\n\n\n\nExample of a hand-coded transcript\n\n\n\nOption 2: Code using Word, by adding comments\n\n\n\n\nExample of a transcript coded using comments on Microsoft Word\n\n\n\nOption 3: Construct a table for your codes and quotes.

    "text": "8.3 Developing themes (Phases 3-6)\nHere, we’ll focus on Phases 3 to 6 of the process. You can find information on each of these phases in the Braun & Clarke (2022) book: Generating Initial Themes (p.78), Developing and Reviewing Themes (p.97), Refining, Defining and Naming Themes (p.108) and Writing up your Analysis (p.118). We also covered how to do Phases 3-6 in in the Thematic Analysis lecture.\n\n8.3.1 Phase 3: Generating initial themes (p.78)\n\nIn this stage, you should sort the codes into potential themes. Here, you will start to analyse your codes, and consider how they might share an idea or concept.\nIt might be helpful to visualise this in some way, and see how the codes fit together.\nYou may have codes that don’t seem to fit anywhere, others will fit neatly into themes, others might be in sub-themes\nYou end this step with a collection of candidate themes (and potentially sub-themes)\n\nPractical steps:\n\nStart to group your initial codes together\nCan you see a pattern of shared meaning across different codes?\nWhat are the similarities across codes?\nEnd this stage by collating all the coded quotes relevant to each theme.\nThemes can be descriptive or interpretative (see Braun & Clarke, 2013, Ch 11).\nUsing tables or mind maps at this stage can be helpful\n\n8.3.2 Phase 4: Developing and Reviewing themes (p.97)\nIn Phase 4, you check your themes to see whether they make sense a) when you look at the coded extracts for that theme and b) when you look at the whole dataset.\nChecking the coded extracts\nReviewing at the level of the coded extracts. Read all the collated extracts for a theme…do they form a coherent pattern? Do they tell an important story about shared meaning? Are you sure they are themes rather than topic summaries?\nIf they seem like themes and the coded extracts fit well underneath them, then move on to checking the themes against the dataset.\nIf they don’t, is it the case that a) the theme itself is problematic and needs reworked or b) the theme is fine, but some of the data doesn’t fit?\nChecking themes against the whole dataset\nLook across the entire dataset and consider your theme(s) – do they accurately reflect the meanings in the dataset? Do they tell you about the important patterns that you observed in the dataset?\nPractical steps:\n\nThis involves checking that the themes ‘work’ in relation to both the coded extracts and the full data-set.\nReflect on whether the themes tell a convincing and compelling story about the data, and begin to define the nature of each individual theme, and the relationship between the themes.\nIt may be necessary to collapse two themes together or to split a theme into two or more themes, or to discard the candidate themes altogether and begin again the process of theme development.\nIt may be that your theme is actually a topic summary and needs reworked.\nNot every participant will make specific reference to every theme - that is ok - but think about how each person is represented in the analysis.\nIt can be helpful at this stage to group the relevant quotes together that represent each given theme\n\n8.3.3 Phase 5: Refining, Defining and Naming Themes (p.108)\n\nDuring this step, you should define and refine the themes.\nDefine and refine = identifying what this theme is about, what aspect of the data is captured by each theme?\nFor each theme, you need to conduct and write a detailed analysis.\nIn your report, you will report one theme with sub-themes or two themes (no subthemes) – do they explain different things without overlapping too much?\nTry to choose names for themes that are not one word or likely to indicate topic summaries (see the Thematic Analysis Lecture and the final Lab if you want to revisit this)\n\nPractical steps:\n\nThis involves being able to explain each theme: ‘What story does this theme tell?’ and ‘how does this theme fit into the overall story about the data?’.\nIdentify the ‘essence’ of each theme and construct a concise, punchy and informative name. Usually, you would aim for two themes for the qualitative report. You will likely have more for a dissertation.\n\n8.3.4 Phase 6: Writing up your Analysis (p.118)\n\nThe analysis should provide a concise, coherent, logical, non- repetitive and interesting account\nThe write up must provide sufficient evidence of the theme(s) (this is where the quotes come in!)\nThe extracts you choose should clearly illustrate the theme.\n\nPractical steps:\n\nFor the RM2 qualitative report, you should report either two themes (no subthemes) or one theme with 2-3 sub-themes. This is to allow you to balance depth and breadth. If you don’t follow these guidelines, it is very likely that your analysis will lack either depth or breadth.\nAs a rough guide, each theme should include approx. two to five quotes to illustrate it in the write up. Think about which quotes best illustrates your analysis.\nIf you are doing a qualitative dissertation, you will have scope to go further with your analysis; it is a good idea to discuss your data with your supervisor throughout the analytic process."

    "text": "8.4 Developing a narrative\nWhen doing your thematic analysis, it is important to develop a narrative and go beyond paraphrasing/summarising your data.\nThematic Analysis requires an active approach from an analyst. It is your role to make sense of the data and to present this in a coherent, understandable and accessible way to the reader. You will take these ‘patterns of meaning’ and make sense of/interpret them, and convey these to the reader.\nOne point to note: Remember that themes do not emerge - this suggests that they are lying in wait for you to discover them, and that the same themes would come up regardless of the analyst. This is not the case - your experiences and interpretations will affect the themes you end up with.\nWhen you present your data in the analysis section, you will have a) your list of themes and b) your quotes. It is your job to combine these with analytical commentary, in order to tell the story of your data. It’s not enough to present the themes and then back these up with quotes - your job is to add in a narrative that brings the themes and the evidence (i.e. quotes) together.\nSemantic and latent analysis\nThematic Analysis allows you to explore semantic or latent themes (or both) in your analysis:\nSemantic: captures explicitly-expressed meaning and stays close to the language of the participants/overt meaning of data, realist. This tends to be somewhat deductive. Semantic approaches still go beyond summarising/paraphrasing.\nLatent: focuses on a deeper, more implicit meaning of the data. What are the underlying meaning, ideas, concepts? This tends to be a bit more inductive.\nThings to be aware of in developing a narrative\n\nRemember to introduce your theme to the reader – what is it about? Don’t start a theme with a quote. If you have sub- themes, still introduce the overall theme briefly before you discuss your first sub-theme\nExplain to the reader why you’ve chosen to include each quote. Why is it important enough to be included? What does it tell us about your data?\nFocus on depth rather than breadth – it is important that we get a real sense of your theme. In the RM2 report you only have 3000 words in total, and so will have to choose what you discuss\nShow the reader who each quote comes from - we should be able to match this up with the demographics table in the Methods section (which then gives us some context). You can do this by using pseudonyms and linking this to the table by using the same names there too.\nThink about where the opportunities are in your data to go beyond description. Is there anything you can infer? If so, remember to be clear with the reader that this is your interpretation. Your reader should be able why you have interpreted the data this way from the quotes you’ve chosen."

These sessions take a little bit deeper dive into some of the topics and may be particularly useful if you are planning on doing a qualitative dissertation next year.\nWatch the video here\n\n8.7.1 Thinking about reflexivity\nWe ask you to think about your own position in the research as part of your RM2 report (there is a section in the methods!).\nThis can be quite tricky to do, but is very important for qualitative research. Some suggestions to get you started:\n\nThink about the topic you are doing for your research and your position in it. Where would you place yourself in relation to it? What are your own views on the topic? Do you feel quite strongly about it or not?\nWrite as you reflect. Writing – be it using pen or pencil on paper, typing on a keyboard, dictating to some voice capture device, or some other mode – is an important tool for developing reflexive depth. It is good to do this at various stages of the research process.\nStart with your own experiences, understandings and views, but then also try to interrogate those (i.e. why do you have these particular understandings, views etc.?)\n\nSome questions that you might ask yourself:\n\nWhat do I expect to come up in the data? How does this relate to what we found?\nWhat broader experiences have I had that might influence how I’m thinking about this?\nWhat are my values (i.e. what is important to me)? What about my beliefs? How might these have infuenced my thinking?\nHow might all of these be connected to my identities and the communities I am a part of?\n\n8.7.2 Becoming familiar with the data\nIt’s important to become familiar with the data in the process of doing the analysis. Read through your data and make the following notes:\n\nThings of potential interest\nIdeas that you might want to explore further when you are coding\nYour responses to the data (e.g. how do you feel when you read it?)\n\nTry to unpick any assumptions you have that underpin your initial reactions and observations:\n\nWhat was familiar?\nWhat was unfamiliar/surprising?\nWhy are you reacting to the data in that way?\n\n8.7.3 Some common problems with thematic analysis\n\nThematic analysis that fails to address the research question.\nUnconvincing or under-developed analysis: 1) Too many or too few themes 2) Too much overlap between themes or themes are unrelated 3) Themes are vague or not internally consistent or coherent\nLittle or no analytic work has been carried out (for example, using data collection questions as ‘themes’).\nMismatch between data and analytic claims (e.g. going beyond what your participants say)\nToo few or too many data extracts (and little or no analytic commentary).\nParaphrasing rather than analysing and interpreting data\nArguing with the data – pointing out the ‘errors’ in a participant’s account.\n\n8.7.4 Strategies for ensuring quality in your analysis\nReflexive journalling\n\nReflect on your experiences throughout the whole research process (not just at the end!)\nThink about your emotional responses to the data\nTry to reflect on your assumptions that you already have about the topic\n\nTalk about your data with others\n\nDiscuss your analysis with other people - it helps to clarify your analytic insights\nDo stages 1-2 in pairs if you want\nDiscuss your findings in groups\nCome along to office hours\nPresent your analysis (even if its preliminary), this can help solidify where we are going with it\n\nGive yourself time\n\nTry not to leave the analysis until the last minute\nGive yourself time to step away and breathe\nPerhaps work on other sections of your report at the same time, so that you have a mental break from analysis\n\nMake sure themes are themes (and be careful when naming them)\nConnelly and Peltzer (2016, p.55): “When a researcher designated a 1-word theme, such as ‘collaboration’, what does that mean in relationship to the experiences of the informants as interpreted by the researcher? Using only 1 word as a theme, there is no way of knowing, for example if the experiences of collaboration were positive or negative, or whether collaboration is important to the nurses. One-word themes do not convey what the researcher found out about collaboration”"

    "section": "9.1 Evaluation in introductions",
    "text": "9.1 Evaluation in introductions\nThe activities in this section are designed to help you improve your evaluation in the introduction of your RM2 report (and your dissertation). To re-cap from RM1, the purpose of your introduction is to provide a rationale for your study and answer the WHY question; why is your study worth doing? You want to sell your idea to the reader, using existing literature to show how you are building on the evidence that is there.\nAlthough ‘identifying the gap’ is something that is often key in quantitative research, building a rationale is not exactly the same in qualitative research. This is because qualitative research tends to be very much situated in the context of the particular study (i.e. why is this particular research topic or question important in this context/with this group). Regardless of whether you include a gap or not (you still can), you should convey to your reader why your study matters (or why a gap you’ve identified is important to explore).\nThings to do and things to avoid\n\nAvoid doing one study per paragraph – instead, build your arguments using multiple sources\nAvoid describing previous studies in a lot of detail – instead, show how your study builds on them\nAvoid critiques that your study cannot answer - instead, focus on aspects that your study will address\nJust because something is never done before, doesn’t make it worth doing; show with evidence why we should do the study.\n\nHere are paragraphs from an imaginary introduction to a qualitative study investigating postgraduate students’ confidence in their zombie apocalypse survival.\nFor each, you can click on them to have a look in depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 1: Using one source, writing descriptively\n\n\n\n\n\nA study by Lane and Karin (2011) looked at zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students. The sample consisted of 25 participants (20 male and 5 female), recruited through convenience sampling. The study employed involved a survey comprising Likert-scale questions designed to measure participants’ self-assessed confidence in various survival skills. Additionally, participants were asked about their exposure to zombie-related media. The data were subjected to t-tests and regression analyses, and the authors’ found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse confidence was exposure to zombie-themed video games.\nThis paragraph uses just one source, and describes the study in a lot of detail. Instead, it would be better to synthesise evidence from multiple studies and focus on what the findings mean, rather than being descriptive about the studies. Something like:\nA study by Lane and Karin (2011) found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students was exposure to zombie-themed video games. Miller and Williams (2023) had similar findings, but exposure to zombie films was also a significant predictor of confidence. This suggests that simulation through media is an effective way to increase self-efficacy towards an unknown threat, which has also been found with alien attack research (Ripley, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 2: Making criticisms that are outwith the scope of your study\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the majority of studies on zombie apocalypse survival confidence have looked at samples that consist of mostly men (Lane & Karin, 2011 but see also Grimes & Dixon, 2019), and that previous samples have been small.\nThis paragraph makes a criticism that the study cannot address - issues with sample size are not something that we can address with qualitative designs.\nInstead, to create a stronger rationale, it would be better to focus your critical evaluation on aspects which your study actually builds on:\nWhile evidence on the behavioural predictors of zombie apocalypse confidence is robust, the majority of research (see Anderson, 2014) has focused on the exposure time to media and survival skills training. Hence, we lack understanding of how participants perceive their confidence beyond simulation experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 3: Why is your study worth doing?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date, there has been only one qualitative study on the topic – Seok (2013) collected data through semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis and two themes, “Survival mode” and “Confidence through skills” were identified. This study looked at undergraduate students; there is no previous literature on postgraduate students’ perceptions of their apocalyptic confidence. Therefore, this qualitative study investigates the perceived confidence of postgraduate students in their abilities to survive a zombie apocalypse.\nJust because it’s never been looked at doesn’t automatically mean it should be - show with evidence why and how you would expect your new sample/method/something else about the study to differ from previous research and why it’s worth exploring:\nPrevious research has looked at undergraduate students; however, it has been suggested that postgraduate students would be the group most at risk during a zombie apocalypse (Williams, 2021), but also that apocalyptic self-efficacy decreases with age (Anderson, 2004). This suggests that postgraduate students are the most mentally and physically vulnerable group during a zombie apocalypse, and hence it is important to understand their perceptions of apocalypse confidence, and the lack of thereof.\n\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Activity 1: RM1 feedback\nGo back to your feedback from RM1 and see what your marker has said about the evaluation ILO and comments for your introduction. List two things that you did well, and two things you want to improve for RM2. If you would like to discuss the feedback and possible improvement points further, you can pop to Wil’s or Ashley’s office hours.\nQuite often what we see is students engaging with a lot of literature in the intro (which is good!), but not really building a rationale or explaining with evidence why the study is worth doing. We want you to move beyond describing the research to critically evaluating it to show how your study expands on existing knowledge.\n\n\n9.1.2 Activity 2: Top tips and rationales in published papers\nTip 1: Show how your study builds on existing literature When you are building your rationale, try to use multiple studies to show your reader what the current context of the literature is, and how your study is expanding that knowledge. What new is your study bringing? How is it expanding on existing studies?\nIf you look at these paragraphs from Robertson et al. (2018), they are building the rationale for their study by showing how it expands on existing literature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a rationale\n\n\n\n“Kerns and Kendall (2012) published an updated review of the prevalence of anxiety in individuals with ASD, and all studies fell within White et al. (2009)’s original range for anxiety symptoms (11–84%). It should be noted that, of the 24 studies included in the review, only two reported data for individuals older than 19 years of age (Bakken et al., 2010, Hofvander et al., 2009), which illustrates the need to also focus on adults with ASD in future research (Howlin, 2000).”\n“Secondly, as far as we are aware, there have been no qualitative studies investigating anxiety in autism using semi-structured interviews. Although focus groups and interviews are both good data collection methods for qualitative data, there is evidence that individual interviews tend to elicit a broader range of discussion points (Guest, Namey, Taylor, Eley, & McKenna, 2017). Again, this further extends the previous investigation conducted by Trembath et al. (2012).”\n\n\nTip 2: Focus your criticism\nWhen you are critically evaluating studies in your introduction, make your criticism focused on things that your study is addressing. This helps you build the rationale. For example, for the RM2 report, don’t focus on the sample size and generalisability of existing studies in your introduction, because these are not things that your study will actually be able to address. Instead, focus on gaps/problems your study can address.\nIf you look at this paragraph from Toivo & Scheepers (2019), they are identifying a gap/problem in existing literature and showing how the new study is addressing this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing cricitism\n\n\n\n“A potential issue in the above SCR studies (as well as in some of the cognitive studies discussed earlier) is that the stimuli were not very tightly controlled in terms of lexical variables (length, frequency, abstractness, etc.), or in terms of syntactic/pragmatic complexity when multi-word phrases were used. This, again, introduces a number of potential confounds (both within and across languages), making it difficult to separate effects of emotional resonance from those related to cognitive effort in word processing. In the present study, we aimed at eliminating such potential confounds by matching our stimuli on a number of lexical variables–as was done in the ERP studies discussed above [22, 23]–and by avoiding the use of translation equivalents.”\n\n\nTip 3: Draw arguments from related topics. \nSometimes if your topic has not been studied much, it might be difficult to create an evidence-based rationale for your research question. In this case, you can draw logical parallels from related topics/domains. Remember to explain to the reader why you would expect the findings to generalise across the related topics.\nIf you look at this paragraph from Mahrholz et al. (2018), it acknowledges that evidence on what they are looking at is scarce in voice perception, but the same effect has been found in face perception:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing arguments from other topics\n\n\n\n“Similarly, looking at reliability of personality traits across presentation durations, Willis and Todorov [40] found that ratings of trustworthiness, competence, likeability, aggressiveness, and attractiveness for faces, showed moderate to strong positive correlations after 100 ms, 500 ms, and 1000 ms, when compared to ratings made without time constraints. Only participants’ confidence in their own judgements increased as a function of duration. Likewise, again using photographs of faces, Bar et al. [33] reported medium positive correlations between ratings at 39 ms and 1700 ms. The authors indicated that the lower threshold was sufficient for reliable assessments of threat but not intelligence, supporting the theory that rapid first impressions serve as a mean of self-preservation and help determine appropriate approach-avoidance behaviour [1, 33, 38]. The idea being that it should not require much information to decide whether a stranger is friend or foe. Finally, Todorov and colleagues [39] obtained a similar finding, again for faces, showing 33 ms of exposure to be sufficient to distinguish between trustworthy- and untrustworthy-looking stimuli. Whilst correlations with control ratings improved between 33 ms and 100 ms, increased exposure duration did not significantly increase the correlations.\nIn voice research, though there are limited studies that consider the reliability of personality judgements across varying lengths of stimulus types, similar findings have been shown as in face research.”\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Activity 3: Active reading\nWhen you are reading journal articles, make sure to take notes and think of how each article can be used to build your rationale in the introduction. Here is a resource you can use to help structure your notes about the studies you are going to use for your introduction."

    "text": "9.2 Evaluation in your analysis section\n\n9.2.1 Activity 1\nComplete this activity to improve your evaluation for your thematic analysis, (as well as the discussion section). You may have already completed this as a part of your Data analysis chapter, but if you haven’t please do it now. We ask you to compare two published papers against some of the qualitative report ILOs.\n\n\n9.2.2 Activity 2: Going deeper in your analysis\nOne of the characteristics of a strong analysis section is that the writer demonstrates an ability to go beyond paraphrasing/summarising. This activity is designed to help you understand what might be involved in doing so.\nRead the following two extracts from an Analysis section and discuss these questions:\n\nWhich of the two examples is better? Why?\nWhat have the authors done that makes the analysis better?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract 1 - from a study about the impact of the COVID pandemic\n\n\n\nSarah spoke of using her leisure time to plan and fantasise about her wedding:\n“it’s enough of a fantasy… it’s meant to be stressful, but it’s really just been fun. It’s like such a nice break from this humdrum life we’re living in right now” (Sarah: lines 459-461).\nOrganising a significant life event seems to be viewed as granting Sarah an escape from her current monotony. While she refers to it as a “fantasy”, potentially given uncertainty of the pandemic’s progression, she appears to perceive this as constructive and realistic for her future self. Alternately, Mandy’s leisure activity involved impossible daydreams:\n“I started daydreaming more ridiculous stuff… I know it’s never going to come true ’cause it’s not real, but it still entertains me” (Mandy: lines 443-444)\nWhile Mandy seems to be under no illusion that her daydreams are feasible, daydreaming impossible scenarios appears to provide more of a release than realistic situations that are subject to ever changing government regulations (e.g. travel bans) that may fall through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract 2 - from a study about social media use during the pandemic\n\n\n\nSome participants said it was difficult to fall asleep at night, including those who knew they should fall asleep but could not (“if I can’t stay up and can’t sleep”- Sarah), or participants subjectively thought that they did not need sleep or did not want to fall asleep (“I am not really able to sleep at night, or like, sleep isn’t really needed.” -Andrew)\nParticipants said that they used social media but that it was only positive at certain points:\nI feel like TikTok was fun in the first lockdown during the summer,’cause of all this summer content I guess, but after that it really went downhill. I don’t know like, OK personally I deleted all my apps about three weeks ago (John)\nJohn tells us here that he deleted all his apps, because they all went ‘downhill’. Tik Tok was helpful during the first lockdown, but not after it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1 (COVID):\nThis is the better example, because it goes beyond paraphrasing. The researcher is analysing the quotes and have engaged with the meaning behind the words. Each quote is selected in a way that helps the author build a narrative of what is happening in the data\nExample 2 (sleep): This is the weaker example, because the author just paraphrases what the participants say. This ends up not adding any real value in terms of analysis, because the reader could just read the quote. The narrative needs to analyse the data and show the reader why they interpret something in a particular way."

    "text": "9.3 Evaluation in discussions\nIn this section, we aim to provide some guidance about how to go beyond description in your writing. We will specifically focus on the Discussion section for your RM2 qualitative report here, but you can apply this to other types of writing. In particular, it should be helpful for you as you proceed to your dissertation.\n\n9.3.1 What were your findings?\nIn your discussion section, start off by telling us what you found in your analysis. However, the key thing to think about here, in terms of evaluation, is to relate your findings to the wider research. It will be likely a good idea to consider on a theme by theme basis (if you are doing themes with no sub-themes) or on a subtheme basis (if you have one theme with 2-3 subthemes).\nSome things to consider:\n\nWhat did you find? What was your specific contribution?\nThinking about your findings, what are the similarities and differences from other research findings/theory? Why might this be the case?\nSituate your findings within the broader context - tell the reader about why your findings are important. This can help a reader understand the importance of the results.\nDo your findings challenge existing research? If so, in what way?\nCan you bring in any critical thinking?\n\n\n9.3.1.1 Activity 1\nRead the paragraphs below from Crompton et al., (2020) and think about what the authors are communicating, with a view to considering the points above.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nHow the authors summarised their results\nThe contribution of the themes to the evidence base\nHow the authors discuss their results in relation to existing research\nHow the authors relate their findings to theory\nHow the authors link the findings to ‘broader issues’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1: Crompton et al., 2020\n\n\n\nThis study aimed to examine the experiences of autistic adults spending time with autistic and non-autistic family and friends using a thematic analysis framework. Social relationships are an important, though often complicated, part of autistic people’s lives. Previous research has tended to focus on autistic people’s relationships with (assumed) non-autistic friends and family. Here, we specifically contrasted relationships across and within neurotypes. The analysis revealed three themes: cross-neurotype understanding, minority status and belonging. The themes help us understand why relationships between autistic and non-autistic people might be so challenging, and how relationships between autistic people are different.\nThe results align with previous research on the challenges that autistic people face when interacting with non-autistic others, but highlight that interactions with other autistic people are fundamentally different. All participants reported that spending time with non-autistic family and friends involved specific difficulties, which were not experienced when interacting with other autistic friends and family. This aligns with the double-empathy theory of autism which suggests that autistic and non-autistic people have a mutual difficulty in understanding and empathising with one another due to differences in how each person understands and experiences the world, rather than because of a communicative deficit on the part of the autistic person (Milton, 2012). Neurotypical people have been shown to overestimate how ego-centric their autistic family members are (Heasman & Gillespie, 2018), and overestimate how helpful they are to autistic people (Heasman & Gillespie, 2019). Our findings suggest that this translates into real-world difficulties in interactions with neurotypical friends and family that may affect the mental health, well-being and self-esteem of autistic people.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 What are the implications of the study?\nIn addition to theoretical implications you would discuss in a quantitative study, there is scope to discuss broader implications here. Try not to go too far in these implications (e.g. saying that the NHS/University could make changes to how they run mental health services…this would require a much more extensive body of work).\nSome things to consider:\n\nHow could these findings be applied to real-life situations?\nWhat impact might this have for society in the future (even if with the caveat that it would depend on future research)?\nCan you back up your assertions with reference to the literature? Arguments here are much stronger if you are able to cite papers to support.\n\n\n9.3.2.1 Activity 2\nRead the paragraph below from Robertson et al. (2018) and think about how the authors have communicated the implications of the research.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nWhat the implications of the research are\nHow the authors link the findings to practical suggestions\nHow the authors back up these suggestions to the existing literature base\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 2: Robertson et al., 2018\n\n\n\nThere are a number of potential clinical applications for the findings detailed in this paper. They echo the modifications that are already undertaken for anxiety interventions designed for children and adolescents with ASD (Walters, Loades, & Russell, 2016). For example, it may be important to include support for individuals undertaking an intervention for their anxiety. This has already been identified as helpful in anxiety management interventions for children with ASD (Sofronoff et al., 2005), but the evidence here suggests that this might also be the case for adults. Furthermore, as adults reported feeling that they enjoyed interacting with other autistic people, it would be important to test whether running autism-only groups in terms of anxiety interventions helps outcomes or other aspects related to the feasibility of anxiety management programs (e.g. retention of participants).\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Limitations\nAll research will have limitations - there is never going to be a perfect study. Research is about weighing up the options and choosing the best design for the specific question we want to answer. Remember that qualitative research is not automatically limited because it is not quantitative. Therefore, be very careful not to use criteria we have for quantitative studies (e.g. generalisability, reliability, small sample sizes) and apply them to qualitative studies. Doing so would be similar to critiquing a behavioural study for not asking participants about their experience of interacting with the stimuli ;)\nSome things to consider:\n\nDo you think the quality, source, or types of data (or the analytic process) might have affected the methodological integrity in some way? If so, how?\nRemember to link your limitations to the evidence base. This makes your argument much stronger than if you do not cite to back your points up.\nIf you want to mention generalisability, perhaps consider the concept of transferability instead, which is much more relevant to qualitative.\nTry to aim for depth rather than breadth here - it’s much stronger to have two points addressed comprehensively than have 12 limitations, each covered in a single sentence (you don’t want to make your discussion section a limitations-fest!).\n\n\n9.3.3.1 Activity 3\nRead the paragraph below from Toivo & Scheepers (2019). Although this is not a qualitative paper, the following paragraph exhibits many of the strengths noted above.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nWhat was the limitation observed?\nHow do the authors discuss this limitation, and consider the effect it might have had?\nHow do the authors back up their arguments with evidence from the literature base?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 3: Toivo et al., 2019\n\n\n\nOne concern might be that we did not explicitly control for L2 proficiency in our sample of bilinguals, which is likely to affect cognitive effort in processing L2. However, all of our bilingual participants (a) self-reported to be highly proficient in English, (b) were Glasgow University students using English as their language of study, and (c) had been living in an English-speaking country for minimum of three months (average: two years and four months) when the study was conducted. Together with the fact that post-trial word recognition rates were well above 90% across participant groups and conditions (Fig 2), we do not believe that variation in L2 proficiency was large enough to have a major impact on our results. That said, we agree that proficiency should ideally be controlled for in future research, e.g. by adding a suitable measure as another person-specific covariate in the analyses. Previous research had identified proficiency as a potential mediating factor of perceived emotionality in the Bilingualism and Emotions Questionnaire [50], and it had also been suggested that bilinguals with close-to-native proficiency in L2 show similar affective processing in L1 and L2 [19].\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.4 Anything else?\nThe points above are the key components that we would expect to see in a Discussion section, with some guidance on how to go beyond description. However, you might also consider strengths and future research. It’s also good to include a brief conclusion. You won’t have the word count available to go into the same detail as in these papers, so try to use the examples above to really focus on what you can incorporate within your Discussion section to strengthen your evaluative writing."

It must be clear for the reader why you have chosen this research question, based on the information presented in the rationale.\nCommunication: Keep your research question simple and specific. If you have a very broad question, it can be helpful to break the question down into smaller sub-questions\n\nType of question: We want the RQ to tap in to more than ‘descriptive’ experience but also offer scope to explore the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of psychological experience–Is the question asking about experiences, understanding, accounts of practice, or influencing factors?\n\nPractical constraints: Can the question realistically be explored using an online focus group methodology and a thematic analysis? You may not cover all aspects of your question in one focus group, so consider which aspects of the research question(s) you want to prioritise.\n\nFlexibility: Research questions are more flexible than hypotheses - it is acceptable for the focus of the RQ to be refined during/after data collection.\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Background to topic (suggested word count = 250 words)\nThe aim for this section is to provide an overview to the topic for the reader. Remember that you will know much more about the topic than the person reading it - you should aim your proposal at someone who knows about psychology but who does not have in-depth knowledge of the topic at hand.\nWe suggest around 250 words for this section, which means that you should aim to provide context for the reader, but not go into lots of depth. What do you think the reader needs to know about the topic in order for you to convince them of the importance of the study in the rationale section? Are there any important theoretical considerations that should be included?\n\n\n10.1.3 Rationale for the study (suggested word count = 500 words)\nThe aim is to provide a justification for your research question : we want you to give a rationale to your methodology and topic. Why is your study worth doing? Show how your study builds on existing literature and back up your arguments with relevant evidence.\nWhy study this topic/research question using qualitative methodology?\n\nExplain why qualitative methods are suited to study your particular research question\nHere, you may want to critique the existing studies that have taken a quantitative approach to your topic - what information/aspect of the topic are they missing?\nHow does qualitative research help further our understanding on the particular topic?\nWhat features of qualitative research help us answer your RQ?\n\nWhy use focus groups?\n\nWhy are focus groups a good methodology to study your particular research question?\nWhat features about focus group help you answer your RQ?\nHere, you may want to critique previous studies using different qualitative or quantitative approaches to your topic; what information are they missing? How is your study addressing this by using focus groups?\n\nWhy look at this specific sample?\n\nWhy is your sample worth studying?\nHow does it differ from other samples that have been studied in your topic?\nHow would studying your sample help us understand the topic better?\nHere, you may want to critique previous studies that have used different samples – what information are they missing? How is your study addressing this by using your specific sample?\n\n\n\n10.1.4 Ethical Considerations (suggested word count = 250 words)\nWhen we are conducting research with human participants, it’s really important to think about the ethical implications of your work. In this section of the proposal, you should identify ONE potential ethical issue relating to your study, and explain how your group is going to address it.\n\nRead the BPS code of ethics and identify one ethical issue with your study\nMake sure the ethical issue you identify is relevant for the methodology and aims of your specific study\nExplain how you would address it when you are running the study\nMake sure to cite the BPS code of ethics when you explain the issue and how to address it. Also cite relevant literature to back up your arguments\nLook at the materials from lab 3 to help you with this part of the proposal."

All the best in writing your report.\n\n11.1.1 Required Submissions\nTwo separate submissions are required for this report:\n\n\nSubmission 1 should contain the report itself, along with the specified sections and appendices.\n\nCover page with title (does not count towards the word limit)\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nMethod\nAnalysis\nDiscussion\nReferences (does not count towards word limit)\nAppendices (does not count towards word limit)\n\n\n\nSubmission 2 should contain the required information about the process of your analysis, using the template provided. Submission 2 does not count towards the word limit. Please note that Phase 6 is not included as this is what you include in your Analysis section\n\nPhase 1 (Familiarisation)\nPhase 2 (Doing Coding)\nPhase 3 (Generating Initial Themes)\nPhase 4 (Developing and Reviewing Themes)\nPhase 5 (Refining, Defining and Naming Themes)\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Submission 1: The Qualitative Report\n\n11.1.2.1 General writing style\n\nYour writing should be clear, concise and easy to follow - remember that academic writing does not need to be complicated to be good. One tip is to use word to read your report back to you – sometimes it’s easier to hear where a point may be overly complex or long and where you might want to cut it down.\nMaintain a neutral, academic tone throughout. Avoid a ‘journalistic’ tone, where you convince the reader based on using emotive language. Instead, show the reader why you think the way you do and the evidence base that underlies this.\nDiscuss one idea/argument per paragraph. An excellent resource to help with this is the reverse outline.\nYou should format your headings, in-text citations and references in APA 7th style.\nAPA writing style encourages the use of active voice (“I coded the data” rather than “the data were coded”) but if you feel more comfortable writing in passive voice, feel free to do so - just make sure to be consistent throughout and be careful not to make your writing overly complex.\nTenses are not always fixed per se (as it depends on how a sentence is structured). However, generally, the following applies – past tense should be used when you have done something already (like your study). For example, we would usually see past tense in the Methods (unless doing a registered report) and the Analysis section. When talking about papers that are already published (in the Intro and Discussion), again these would typically be in past tense.\nYou can use first person singular (I) or plural (we) in the report itself if you want to, but in the reflexivity section make sure to write in first person singular. This is because this is your reflection of your own positionality to the RQ and the data, and it’s often very personal.\n\n11.1.2.2 Title\nThe title should be included as part of the cover page. It should reflect the research question(s) and define your sample (e.g., UG students experience of…). Try to be specific - your title should include:\n\nWho\nWhat\nHow\n\nExamples:\n\nA Thematic Analysis (how) of the panic attack experiences (what) of primary aged children in inner city Schools in the UK (who)\n\nBarriers and enablers to modifying sleep behaviour (what) in adolescents and young adults (who): A qualitative investigation (how)\n\n\n11.1.2.3 Abstract (suggested word count: 100-150 words)\nIn an academic journal, the function of an abstract is to give readers a snapshot of the whole paper. They then use this to decide whether or not to read the full article. Therefore, you should make sure you cover all four main sections of your report, summarising them all succinctly.\nAim to summarise all sections of the report in 150 words, including; 1) what does the existing literature tell us about the topic 2) aim of the study 3) brief methodology, 4) approach to analysis , 5) main findings, and 6) key aspects of the discussion. Keep in mind that you are summarising your research for a non-expert and you want to “entice” them to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nStart out by writing four sentences, each summarising one section of the report (introduction, methods, analysis, discussion). Now, look at the six sections above and see where you might need to add a bit of detail.\nOne common mistake is to ignore the discussion, saying something like ‘Findings are discussed in relation to existing research’. This doesn’t tell us anything about what your overarching thoughts are about your findings and how they relate to the literature base.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2.4 Introduction (suggested word count 750-850 words)\nSome activities to support you with writing your Analysis section can be found in Chapter 11.\nThe introduction should give readers enough background to understand your rationale for further research, whether your study is qualitative or quantitative. Provide a clear, critical review of the most relevant published research and highlight the key issues and debates in the field. Use these to build a logical argument for your study.\nFollow the APA-style funnel structure: begin with a broad overview of the topic, then narrow the focus until you reach your specific rationale and research question(s).\nBecause your word count is limited, focus on recent and directly relevant studies—especially the latest qualitative research in this specific area. Show how your project builds on the most recent work to strengthen your rationale. Remember to cite all sources used, including government reports, websites, and media items.\nA resource for helping you to develop evaluation in your introductions can be found at the start of Chapter 11.\n\n\n\n\nBroad-to-narrow structure of an introduction\n\n\n\nYou should end with a statement of what the aim of your study was, and the research question.\nWhen reviewing previous studies, don’t just describe them - evaluate them. Highlight their limitations, but only those your study can realistically address. Consider what the findings mean, note any conflicting results, and think about why they differ. This should naturally build toward a clear rationale for your own study.\nThen, explain your study and clearly state your research question(s), ensuring they connect directly to the issues raised in your introduction.\nIn summary:\n\nReview and critically evaluate relevant theories and research.\nJustify your study by linking gaps or limitations in past work to your research questions.\nClearly outline your main and subsidiary research questions, ensuring these are phrased in a way that aligns with a qualitative approach.\n\nRemember: just like in a quantitative report, this section shows what has been done before and why your study is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nIn your rationale, remember to tell the reader why the current study (i.e. the topic and group of participants) is important.\nIf identifying limitations of existing research, make sure to pick something that you are able to address in your study. If you say that one issue is that heart rate wasn’t gathered, but you don’t do this in your study, this can be confusing for a reader.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2.5 Method (suggested word count: 350-450 words)\nThe aim of the method section is to clearly report how your study was conducted – the reader should be able to re-run your research from the details provided. In this case, report details of your focus group and the qualitative analysis you used. True ‘replication’ is difficult due to central role of researcher in influencing some aspects of the research such as analysis. This is not an experiment.\nParticipants & Recruitment\nHow many, who were they? Include their age, gender and nationality if known. How were they sampled? Why were your participants right for the study? In this study, participants were sampled from a group of PG students as part of their course requirements. A table of relevant participant characteristics is recommended - please see the example in this document\nAPA Styles has more information about how to report tables in APA format\nData Collection\nWhat materials did you use to run the focus group? What information was given to participants? How was the focus group recorded, and how long did it take? Tell the reader about your approach to this, did you follow rapport building guidelines? Refer to the focus group questions in the appendices.\nEthics\nInclude a brief account of the ethical procedures and consider both ‘formal ethics’ (getting consent) as well as more nuanced ‘non-formal’ such as the rapport building, consent as a process and reflective practices of researcher (this may warrant its own sub-heading).\nReflexivity\nIn qualitative research it is important to acknowledge the role of the researcher in interpretation of the data (Elliot et al., 1999).\nThis is where you question your own motives and attitudes in doing this project. Obviously we told you that you had to do it. But, what motivated you to choose the dataset you did? What assumptions did you hold prior to beginning the research? Had you considered issues around the topic previously? Did they match what the interviews say, or did you disagree with them? Did this affect which interviews you chose to include in your analysis? And if so, how did this impact on your analysis? Because different people would interpret the data differently, it is useful for you to expose your own attitudes at this point so that others can see how you have impacted on the analysis.\nSee Braun & Clarke (2013, pp36-37, 303-304) and activities around reflexivity. Reflexive analysis should be concise for this project, perhaps around 3-4 sentences. However, you will also have to include a reflexivity diary as a part of your appendices.\nData Analysis\nIn this section, explain:\n\nWhat analysis method you used and your theoretical approach (see the ‘Thinking about theory’ mini-lecture for a reminder).\nThe stages of your qualitative analysis. Be clear and specific - qualitative work is sometimes criticised for being vague. Use recognised guidelines (e.g., Smith for IPA; Braun & Clarke for Reflexive Thematic Analysis).\n\nWhen outlining the stages:\n\nGive a brief summary of the full process, linked to the relevant framework (e.g., RTA). Around three to four sentences total is enough for this length of report.\nYou can keep some phases short (e.g., “familiarisation with the data (Phase 1); generating codes (Phase 2)…”).\nAim for transparency - explain what happens between coding and theme development.\nDescribe the researcher as actively identifying themes, not waiting for themes to “emerge,” which incorrectly suggests they are already there waiting to be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nIn the methods section, try to be precise and succinct in your writing (this applies to the whole report, but is particularly important here). Think about what the reader needs to know and how to best communicate this.\nCommon errors include inaccurate information (e.g. the wrong number of Phases in Braun & Clarke’s framework) and a superficial reflexivity section.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2.6 Analysis (suggested word count: 750-900 words)\nThe analysis section is where you present the evidence you’ve collected. It works like a Results section in a quantitative report.\nYour goal is to make the analysis transparent, showing clearly how your interpretations come from the transcripts. Use extracts from the transcripts to support all quotes and interpretations.\nGuidelines\n\nChoose a maximum of two themes or one theme with two sub-themes to include in the Analysis section, even if you found more. You will not be able to go into enough depth if you present more themes than this, due to the word count restrictions.\nIf you want to use parts of a quote, rather than the full quote (e.g. maybe you want to remove the middle sentence, which doesn’t add anything), you can indicate you omitted something with ellipses.\nNever alter any of the words or phrasing that is used, even if you think you know what the participant was going to say. This would be as unacceptable as editing numbers in a quantitative analysis!\nTry to strike a balance between quotes and interpretation. We sometimes see lots of quotes with very little analysis or lots of analysis with very few quotes, both of which have problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI and data\n\n\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, put the transcripts or quotes from the transcripts into GenerativeAI (this includes CoPilot). This will not have been agreed as part of the original ethics and participants will not have consented for this use of the data.\nFailing to follow these instructions puts you at risk of academic and research misconduct.\n\n\nStructuring the Analysis section\n\nStart with a short paragraph summarising the main themes without using any quotes. This should not be too long - perhaps around a sentence or two.\nIf you have two themes:\n\nPresent each theme using a sub-heading\nGive the reader a brief overview of what the theme is. It is likely that you will have to select a few key points that encapsulate your theme, rather than describe everything in your theme in detail. For a dissertation, where you have more available word count, you will be able to cover more.\nOnce you’ve introduced the theme, tell the reader about what you found in your analysis of this theme. Make sure to incorporate quotes to support your analytical points.\n\n\nIf you have one theme and two sub-themes:\n\nHave sub-headings for the overall theme as well as the sub-themes.\nBriefly explain the overarching theme and then how the sub-themes relate to the larger theme. Do not present quotes at this point.\nThen, present each of the sub-themes in turn, under sub-headings. In each of these, tell the reader what you found in the analysis of your theme and incorporate quotes to support your analytical points.\n\n\n\nPresenting Quotes\nUse long quotes by placing them in a separate, centred indented block. Short quotes can be included within the sentence. Due to the word count, you are likely to be able to do a maximum of one or two longer quotes per theme or sub-theme.\nYou can find guidance on presenting participant quotes in APA format in the recommended resources. Although the word limit suggested here is 40 words, this is quite long and so we suggest taking it on a case by case basis (e.g. having a quote of 39 words within a sentence might be correct but also might be confusing to read). You can run anything past us if you are unsure.\nWe have also prepared an example of how to format quotes in APA style.\nGoing Beyond Paraphrasing\nA strong analysis section will analyse the data, going beyond summary and paraphrasing. What do you add, as the analyst? You will have much more knowledge of the data, and it is your job to pass on that insight. If you paraphrase the data, the reader will be able to see this in the quotes, but the analysis then doesn’t add anything extra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInstead of telling the reader what was talked about, explain what the things that were talked about reveal or suggest about the phenomenon you are studying.\n\n\nAvoid writing themes that are topic summaries, as these are at a descriptive level.\n\nA theme of “Stress and workload” is mainly descriptive. It tells us the topics that participants mentioned, but not why they matter or how they relate.\nA theme of “Stress is an unavoidable requirement of ‘being a good student’” is interpretative. It goes further by explaining what stress means for the participants. For example, the data might show that students see stress as tied to their identity as students and that this is something that they expect, rather than something to avoid.\n\nThis kind of deeper interpretation goes beyond the superficial to show the reader what the data suggests, rather than just summarising it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nThere is no single “correct” interpretation, but you must show clearly how your interpretation is supported by the quotes you use.\nGo beyond describing the data—explain the underlying meaning.\nChoose quotes that directly support the point you are making; the connection should be obvious to the reader.\nFollow the guidelines: include the recommended number of themes/sub-themes, and balance quotations with your interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2.7 Discussion (suggested word count: 750-850 words)\nSome activities to support you with developing evaluation in your Discussion section can be found in Chapter 11.\nThe Discussion is where you bring together your findings and consider these in light of the literature (and theory). It is also where you consider the wider importance of your findings, reflect on limitations and think about potential implications and future directions.\nStart with a brief recap\n\nRemind the reader of the theme/s you report in the Findings and relate these to your Research Question.\n\nConnect your findings to past research\nNote: This should be the largest section within your Discussion.\n\nHere, compare your results with the studies and theories you mentioned in the Introduction, as well as any new studies/theories you want to incorporate.\n\nSay whether your findings support or contradict those from the literature base. However, also go beyond this and tell us what this means, more broadly. Why might this be important?\nSay whether your findings extend/challenge what is already known. If so, tell us what this means/why it is important, and back your points up with evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing beyond ‘agreement/disagreement’\n\n\n\nIt is important to go beyond simple agreement or disagreement, and interpret the data. The following is a ‘not so great’ example:\n\n“Our theme showed that postgraduate students felt a lot of pressure to succeed, but they did not agree on what “success” actually meant. This is similar to Skye (2023) who said that postgraduates think success means getting good grades, although some thought it meant being a good group member or answering questions in class. Therefore, our results match Skye’s findings.”\n\nThis is a stronger example:\n\n“Our theme showed that postgraduate students feel strong pressure to ‘succeed,’ yet they hold different and sometimes conflicting ideas about what success actually means. This supports Skye’s (2023) finding that, while many postgraduates focus on good grades, others define success through group contribution or speaking up in class. Our findings add to this by showing that it is even more complex, as students tend to hold multiple ideas of success at the same time, creating uncertainty about how to meet expectations. This shows that success is not a fixed standard but something students actively negotiate in response to academic norms and peer pressures. This emphasis on negotiation echoes Isla’s (2025) findings that medical staff similarly construct their professional identities in relation to shifting expectations.”\n\nIn the second, the author goes into more depth and explains to the reader what the current findings add. They also then explain this by linking (through the observation that negotiation was key) to a relevant finding from a different field.\n\n\nDiscuss implications\n\nExplain any practical or theoretical implications of your findings. Remember to make these realistic and linked to your findings.\nTry to make these concrete suggestions, rather than vague statements.\nRemember to back these points up with evidence from the literature base.\n\nReflect on limitations\n\nIn this length of report, we suggest picking a maximum of one or two limitations, so that you have the opportunity to develop some depth.\nAvoid limitations that are more suited to quantitative studies\n\nsample size\nlack of generalisability\n\n\nThink about limitations that are relevant instead\n\nThe kinds of experiences or voices not represented\nWhat the research design prioritised or obscured\nHow the method of data collection might have shaped interpretation\n\n\nAs with the other sections, the limitations section is stronger when you clearly link to the evidence base.\n\nSuggest future research\n\nShow what you would do differently next time and why. Propose ideas for studies that naturally follow from your findings.\nLink to the literature base to support your points.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrow-to-broad structure of a discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nLink to evidence in support of the points you are making throughout the whole Discussion section (including limitations, implications and future directions).\nPick limitations that are relevant to qualitative research.\nIt’s okay to bring in new literature into the Discussion, but try to also bring back key studies/theories that you introduced earlier on in the report.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2.8 Recap of word count for each section of the report\n\n\nAbstract: 100-150 words\n\nIntroduction: 700-800 words\n\nMethod: 350-450 words\n\nAnalysis: 750-900 words\n\nDiscussion: 750-850 words\n\nWe understand this can feel like a lot to fit into the report, but it’s a good chance to practise writing concisely. It’s okay to go slightly outside these guidelines, but try not to deviate too much.\nA common mistake is making the abstract or method section longer than recommended, which then affects the quality of the other sections.\nIf you’re struggling with the word count, feel free to drop into office hours. We can’t give general feedback, but you’re welcome to ask specific questions about how you might condense your report.\n\n11.1.2.9 References\nCitations in the main body of the text and references in the reference list are structured in exactly the same way as in a quantitative report, using APA 7th style.\n\n11.1.2.10 Appendices\nThe appendices can often hold a lot of information. In the qualitative report we ask you to include the following in the appendices of the report:\n\n\nRequired: A list of the interviews you have chosen and a link to the original dataset (do not include the transcripts themselves)\n\nRequired: A reflexivity diary that you have developed over the course of completing your analysis. Please use the template linked here to complete your diary.\n\nRequired: You might have a list of the interview questions (if easily obtained from your transcripts or study documentation on UK data service)\nThere may be other appendices you choose to include. If in doubt, please ask and we will do our best to help.\n\n11.1.3 Submission 2: Step-by-step Evidence of the Analysis Process\nThis year, we are asking that all students in RM2 complete two separate submissions for their qualitative report.\n\nSubmission 1 = full report with cover sheet and appendices\nSubmission 2 = step-by-step evidence of your Reflexive Thematic Analysis\n\nSubmission 2 will be formally assessed through the fourth ILO in ‘Evaluation’.\nThe reasons for this requirement are three-fold:\n\n\nTo support your learning of rigorous qualitative research skills.\nReflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) relies on transparency, reflexivity, and a clear audit trail of decisions. By documenting each step, you gain a deeper understanding of how qualitative analysis works and build skills that are essential for doing high-quality research.\n\n\nTo ensure that your submitted work reflects your own analytic thinking.\nWe know that generative AI tools are now widely accessible, and while they can be useful for support, they cannot replace the reflective, interpretive, and creative thinking at the heart of RTA. Taking the process step-by-step helps you to demonstrate your genuine engagement with the data and protects the integrity of your work.\n\n\nTo help you experience RTA as a process, not just a product.\nGood RTA is not about producing a set of themes; it is about the journey you take to get there. Keeping a portfolio helps you slow down, think critically, and make your analytic decisions visible. This will lead to richer insights and a stronger final analysis.\n\n\nIn short, we hope that this requirement for keeping a transparent record of your analytic journey will help you produce stronger work and deepen your understanding of qualitative research.\nThe template can be found here\nAnswers to some questions\n\n\nWhat advice do you have for completing this process? Our main piece of advice is to work on the reflexivity diary (part of the appendices) and the ‘evidencing the process’ template while you are working on the project. You should be completing these steps anyway as part of the analysis, so it should be a case of logging the evidence as you go. If, however, you do not complete it as you go along, this would make it very difficult to include properly at the last minute.\n\nCan I use NVivo? For this assignment, no. We plan to develop guidance that considers how students can best use NVivo in the age of GenAI, but this will take some time to develop properly.\n\nI developed three themes, but can only report two in the qual report itself: What do I do? It probably makes sense to include all of the information up until the end of Phase 4, as often the themes are intermingled together. However, for the Phase 5 part (naming and defining the themes), it is up to you: you can include all of your themes or you can include only those that are in the report.\n\nBelow, we have prepared some guidance for each section to help you.\n\n11.1.3.1 Phase 1: Familiarisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1: What is asked for?\n\n\n\nIn the template, we ask for your familiarisation notes, when you read through each transcript.\n\n\nGuidelines for Phase 1\nFamiliarity notes are brief reflections written while reading and re-reading the data. They are often messy and very personal and are not ‘right’ or ‘wrong’.\nThey tend to capture:\n\nFirst impressions\nWhat stands out\nWhat seems confusing or unusual\nEmotional reactions\nQuestions or curiosities\nEarly ideas about what the participant might be “doing” with their words\nNoticing of tone, contradictions, or patterns\n\nSome things you might note down:\n\nWhat immediately grabs your attention?\nHow do you feel in response to what you’re reading?\nWhat do you think the participant is trying to express? Why do you think this?\nAre any ideas or experiences repeated?\nDo they say things that don’t fit together?\nWhat are you curious about? What would you ask them if you could?\nAnything about their background that shapes how you read this?\nHow do your assumptions/interests shape what seems important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a short example of a familiarisation note, to give you a sense of what might be expected.\n“My first impression is that Participant 1 feels overwhelmed but also quite capable, which creates an interesting tension. Words like ‘pressure’, ‘everyone watching’, and ‘expectations’ make me think they’re under a lot of stress. I notice I feel a bit anxious reading this - maybe because I’ve had similar experiences. I’m also interested in their comment about ‘putting on a front’ at work. It makes me wonder why they feel they can’t be their real self in that situation.”\nThis familiarity note captures initial impressions, points to specific language that shaped those impressions, and reflects openly on personal reactions while reading. It also highlights moments that stood out and raises gentle questions, showing curiosity rather than early analysis.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.3.2 Phase 2: Developing Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 2: What is asked for?\n\n\n\nIn the template, we ask for you to provide a table with all of your codes in it.\n\n\nGuidelines for Phase 2\nWhen coding, think about the following:\n\nWork through your data section by section, thinking about what feels meaningful, interesting or like there is a pattern\nCreate short labels (codes) that capture the essence of what each highlighted section is doing, saying, or representing\n\nRemember that you can be flexible with the coding process. You can create as many codes as you need, and you can merge or rename them later. This allows you to remain responsive as your coding develops over the dataset.\nTry to keep your coding active and interpretive, focusing on meaning instead of counting how often something appears.\nIf you are unsure whether to code something or not, err on the side of caution and include it. This will help you avoid overlooking sections that seem contradictory, subtle, or hard to interpret\nKeep a note of your reflections in your reflexivity diary as you code, which will help in later phases.\n\n11.1.3.3 Phase 3: Generating initial themes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3: What is asked for?\n\n\n\nIn the template, we ask you to a) tell us about your initial themes and/or subthemes, b) tell us the process of how you developed these, and c) tell us about the initial patterns you observed.\n\n\nIn this section, you start to group together your codes into themes. Some parts might come together nicely and others might feel more difficult to put into groups. This is part of the process and nothing to worry about!\nGuidelines for Phase 3\nWhen forming your initial themes, think about the following:\n\nLook across all your codes and identify broader meaning-based patterns.\nGroup together codes that seem related, connected, or part of a shared story.\nNotice similarities, differences, tensions, and recurring ideas across your coded data. Sometimes you can have themes that look contradictory on the surface, but there is shared meaning underneath.\nCreate rough theme names that capture the central idea or organising concept in each cluster.\nWrite a short description of what each initial theme is about and why it matters.\nWrite reflections about how you developed the theme (e.g., repeated emotions, shared experiences, contradictions you observed).\nRemember these are initial themes - this is not the final version and they can change, merge, or be dropped in later phases.\n\n11.1.3.4 Phase 4: Developing and Reviewing Themes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 4: What is asked for?\n\n\n\nIn the template, we ask for you to provide details of how your themes changed from the initial themes you identified in Phase 3.\n\n\nIn this section, this is where you really think about what your themes mean, and how they relate to each other. There is often some back-and-forth during this part of the process, and students often end up going back to Phase 3 (or even 2).\nGuidelines for Phase 4\n\nRevisit the coded extracts for each theme and check whether they truly fit together and reflect a coherent idea.\nLook for any extracts that feel out of place, unclear, or better suited to a different theme — or that suggest a new theme.\nRefine each theme’s focus by clarifying its central organising concept: what is the core meaning holding this theme together?\nCheck whether themes are too broad, too narrow, overlapping, or repetitive, and adjust by splitting, combining, or renaming.\nReview themes against the full dataset to ensure they capture important patterns across the data, not just isolated points.\nConsider whether any parts of the dataset have been overlooked or require revisiting earlier phases of coding or theme development.\nMake notes about how your themes changed (e.g., merged, refined, expanded) and why these changes improved the analysis.\nEnsure each theme tells a meaningful, distinct part of the overall story you are constructing about the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a short example of how a researcher might change themes from Phase 3 to Phase 4, to give you a sense of what might be expected.\nInitial Theme (Phase 3): “Feeling Under Pressure”\n\nThis theme was developed from a cluster of codes including “pressure to perform”, “fear of being judged”, and “trying to keep up”.\nIt seemed that participants were describing feeling stressed and overwhelmed by expectations.\n\nRefinement Process (Phase 4)\n\nWhen reviewing coded extracts, I noticed that some excerpts were more about external expectations (e.g., others judging them), while others were about internal expectations (e.g., pushing themselves).\nThis suggested that this initial theme was too broad, and actually captured two different patterns, so I split the theme into two themes.\nI then changed the names to better reflect the differences between these themes.\n\nRefined Themes (Phase 4): Theme 1: “Navigating Others’ Judgements” and Theme 2: “Holding Myself to High Standards”\n\n“Navigating Others’ Judgements”\n\n\nThis theme captures experiences of being watched, evaluated, or compared to others, reflecting a concern about how others perceive the participant.\n\n\n“Holding Myself to High Standards”\n\n\nThis theme reflects participants’ self-imposed pressure, perfectionism, and high standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.3.5 Phase 5: Refining, Defining and Naming Themes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 5: What is asked for?\n\n\n\nIn the template, we ask to a) tell us how you came up with your theme names and b) provide a definition for your theme/s.\n\n\nIn this section, this is where you aim to clearly articulate what each theme is about, define its boundaries, and give it a meaningful name that captures its central organising concept.\nGuidelines\n\nRevisit each theme and identify its central organising concept (the key idea that holds the theme together).\nWrite a clear explanation of what each theme is about, focusing on the shared meaning across the extracts, not just the topic.\nKnow the boundaries of the theme - what belongs in it and what does not? One suggestion is to imagine you are telling someone who doesn’t know your research about your theme. What would you include in such a summary?\nCheck that each theme is distinct from the others and not overlapping, repetitive, or too similar in focus.\nRefine the name of the theme so it captures its core meaning in a concise, engaging, and conceptually clear way. Avoid one word theme names or names that are very descriptive.\nWrite a brief description of how each theme contributes to your overall analysis.\nEnsure each theme connects back to your research question and supports the analytical narrative you are building.\n\n11.1.3.6 Coded transcripts\nHere, we ask that you provide all of your transcripts that have been coded (we advise two or three, with a max of four if doing the couples dataset). If you have coded the transcripts multiple times, please only include one set of transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoded transcripts: What is asked for?\n\n\n\nIn the template, we ask for you to provide all of your coded transcripts. These should either be commented in Word or scans of physical copies."

    "section": "12.1 General Qualitative project questions",
    "text": "12.1 General Qualitative project questions\n1. Is diversity of participants important in qualitative studies? I am a bit confused because my intuition would say yes but then it’s very hard to have diversity if you only use a few participants?\nI would say that it’s more important that your sample shares certain characteristics for qualitative, rather than it being diverse. We are looking for depth in qualitative rather than breadth, and if your group shares certain experiences, then you might be more likely to get a deep understanding of a particular phenomenon.It’s sometimes the case that you might ask different groups about the same topic (e.g. clients, psychologists, relatives) as they will have different perspectives about the same thing. This could be one way of getting diversity in a qualitative study.\n2. How will the qualitative study be different from our quantitative report that we did last semester?\nThere are a number of similarities in terms of structure (i.e. you will have an Abstract, Methods, Analysis (this is the same section as Results in quantitative) and Discussion) of the actual report itself. It will be mainly different in that you are collecting your own data by running a focus group, and you will conduct thematic analysis rather than statistical analysis on your data. You will also write all sections of the report in a single file, rather than having it separated in a Stage 1/Stage 2 Report format.\nPlease note that the Qualitative proposal is not the same as an Introduction and Methods.\n3. Will we be using R Studio for the study?\nNo, you do not use R Studio for qualitative analysis. We do use similar terms at points (e.g. coding), but coding in qualitative analysis is very different to quantitative. You will learn about the process of analysis in the lectures and the labs throughout the semester.\n4. Are we allowed to use mixed methods for our study or does it have to be “pure” qualitative?\nThe study must be qualitative only, and must follow the guidelines that we present to you as part of the course. You will generally collect demographics, and these must be dealt with in a qualitative, rather than quantitative, way.\n5. How much freedom do we have after submitting our proposal when it comes to data analysis?\nThe main aspects of the report that are fixed are the data collection and data analysis methods, so you are asked to do a focus group and then analyse it using thematic analysis. So, you can’t use interviews, for example, or analyse it using IPA. However, you do have a fair bit of flexibility, in that you can choose which theme/s to present in the results section. You can present one larger theme, and look at a two different sub-themes or you can present two themes with no sub-themes. Also, if your focus group ended up talking less about your research question and perhaps went in a direction that’s a little different to what you expected, you are allowed to tweak the RQ afterwards, and your analysis can be on what was covered in the focus group itself.\n6. How should I manage my time on RM2? There are a few different ways to prioritise things\nWe have developed a suggested timeline for the project, which breaks down tasks for each week. This would serve as a good start for you to manage your time effectively, and you can alter it as required. We have placed this timeline at the top of the different sections within this book, so it is prominent."

    "section": "12.2 Group Proposal",
    "text": "12.2 Group Proposal\n1. Do we have to consider ontology/epistemology in the group proposal?\nNo, although you can if you want. We do, however, ask you to consider this in your individual qualitative report.\n2. Is there a suggested structure for the group proposal?\nWe have split the proposal into separate sections to guide you with the structure; see more information in the Group proposal section. In addition to presenting your research question, we ask you to cover the following three areas in your submission:\n\nBackground to the topic\nRationale for your study\nEthical considerations\n\nRemember that we use the ILOs to mark the assessment (you can find these in the Assessment Information Sheet), so you should use these as guidance.\n3. Should we talk about our actual methodology eg. Teams, how many questions, use of camera etc in the rationale?\nNo, this information is more important for your method section in the full report. You should talk about why you are using qualitative methods, why you are studying this particular sample and why focus group is the appropriate methodology for your RQ.\n4. Is there a rough word count for each section of the rationale?\nYou can see a suggested word count for each section on the Group Proposal template\n5. Is the group proposal similar to the introduction part of the final report? As it covers literature search, the rationale and RQ?\nThe proposal is designed to help you write the full individual report; you can use parts of the proposal to build your introduction (we expect you to expand on this, but the literature search and argument construction you do for the proposal will help with the introduction). The ethics section will help you with methods.\n6. Can we slightly change the topic to look at a particular aspect (e.g. look at belonging in international students from China) or do we have to stick very closely to the topic guide?\nYou can alter it s long as it is still broadly under the topic, but remember that this will have a knock-on impact on the questions you can use (e.g. you might have to add some to those available in the question bank). You are allocated another group in your lab rather than recruiting yourself, so you would need to make sure that the characteristics of the participants in your allocated group are relevant for the research question you have chosen.\n7. For the literature review in the rationale, can I use articles that are older than 5 years? As sometimes I might open a recent article (e.g. 2021) but it references inside it a study done in (eg.2014) so can I still cite that?\nYes, this is fine - try to generally use up to date references where you can, but having a mix of older and more recent studies is fine :). You are not banned from using older studies completely!"

    "title": "12  Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "12.3 Data collection",
    "text": "12.3 Data collection\n\n12.3.1 Focus group questions\n1. Is our report written in a specific style, e.g. IPA, thematic analysis etc? And, if so, should this inform the questions that we need to ask our Focus Group?\nYou must use thematic analysis to analyse your data from the focus group. We are covering this in detail in the lectures, and we will also cover data analysis in the labs. This analytic approach does not need to specifically inform the questions you ask in the focus group - the main thing is to ask questions that are open, appropriate and will help you to answer the research question that you have chosen.\n\n\n12.3.2 Setting up/running the focus group\n1. Where do we get our participants from for the focus group? Do we advertise on social media?\nNo, you will not recruit any participants yourself for the project. As part of the course, each group will a) run a focus group and b) participate in a focus group. This means that your participants for the focus group will be another group within the same lab as you. The course leads allocate each group, and you can find the breakdown of which group will be your participants in the group allocation sheet that is released at the start of Week 2.\n2. Can we prep the focus group with a small questionnaire before/after – (to either provide a clear focus prior to, or garner benefits of the discussion afterwards?\nThis is an interesting idea. Could you get in touch with us to discuss in a bit more detail? We’re unable to say definitively either way at the moment and would need to know a little more about what you are intending. However, if you mean to gather demographic information, then yes, this is fine (see the next question!).\n3. Should we collect demographics?\nYes, generally it is helpful to collect demographic information. We’d advise you to use Microsoft Forms to collect these, as then the information will be kept safe, and it’ll be easy to send the link out to the people participating in your focus group before you meet. It’s up to you to decide what demographics you want to include - the purpose should be to help the reader know more about the characteristics of your sample, especially those characteristics that might be relevant for your focus group. An example might be collecting data on whether your participants have children or not; this would be relevant if your focus group was on the topic of responsibilities of postgraduate students whereas it would be less relevant if it was about belonging to the university as a second-language speaker of English. We will talk more about how this should be presented later - remember you don’t do descriptive statistics in qualitative research, so the information would likely be presented in the Methods section only.\n4. How can we stress the importance of confidentiality?\nWe have a number of different processes in place to ensure confidentiality, and it’s important that everyone adheres to these. Firstly, the consent form contains the statement “I understand that I have a responsibility to ensure that I keep any details that arise during the discussion confidential”. However, those running the focus group also have a responsibility to keep things confidential, and this is vital. Participants should therefore be aware of the importance of confidentiality, but it is a good idea to set out any ‘ground rules’ (for both those running and participating in the group) at the start. Secondly, we require that transcripts are anonymised, and we will spend some time discussing this in the labs.\n5. How is the FG is going to be operationalised? Are we supposed to host a meeting with the other group as a full team, and assign one person asking questions while the rest of us doing note-taking?\nYou can find out more information about this in the Data Collection section. In a nutshell, you will host a meeting on Teams with the other group, and record this. Two people from your group at a minimum have to attend the group (the facilitator and note-taker). However, if the rest of your team would like to come along and watch (or take notes, if they wish), then this is fine as long as the group being interviewed agree (please ask them in advance). From the group running the focus group, Only the facilitator should speak (other than introductions) - anyone who is just watching must not engage in the focus group at any point.\n6. In terms of piloting the focus group schedule, who should this be with? Does it need to be within our lab or this course?\nThere are very few restrictions on this - the key thing is that you get people to look through the questions and comment on them (this can even be done via email, for example). It’s not necessary that you have to run a pretend focus group, or that you have to ask only those in the same lab as you (although you can if you want to!). The only thing that we ask is that you don’t pilot the questions on the same group that you run the focus group on.\n7. On the 30-45 minute timeline for the focus group, does that include the time we should allow for introductions at the start?\nNo, it is for the discussion portion. It is find to add another 10-15 mins on for introductions and wrapping the group up.\n8. Should we set up our focus group now to choose a time to suit all participants, or are there specified slots when we will be doing this (e.g. in lab)?\nPlease set up a time yourself for your focus group - we won’t be doing this during lab time.\n9. Do we circulate information sheet, consent form and questions at the same time as meeting set up so participants have time to reply?\nYes, this sounds like a good idea. You can send things separately though if it is better. For the questions, we ask that they are sent a mimumum of 24 hours before the focus group. Consent forms should be returned before the focus group starts.\n10. We’ve picked two people to run the focus group (facilitator and note-taker) but the rest of us would like to attend. Would this be okay?\nAs long as your focus group participants agree to this, then it’s fine. However, it would be best to ensure the mics and screens are turned off for the ‘extra’ observers during the discussion of the focus group - this way the participants can focus on the facilitator and the questions being asked.\n11. Can we share the role of moderator/swap half-way with the note-taker?\nIf you want to do this, that’s okay. However, please let your participants know at the start of the group, and specify the role of each person.\n12. How do we use Microsoft Forms for gathering demographics or sharing information sheet and consent forms?\nYou should use Microsoft Forms for gathering demographics - guidance is given in the Data Collection section.\n14. If the participants are not answering a question, can I, as the researcher, talk about my own experiences to start the discussion?\nA very interesting question! I would err on the side of not to share your own experiences in the actual focus group, because this could then affect what particpants end up sharing. A couple of suggestions would be to follow up with prompts, or to leave that question and move on to the next one and then come back to it later on. It might just be that it’s a little too early on in the discussion and would be better to wait until people are a bit more relaxed and warmed up :)."

    "section": "12.4 Qualitative report",
    "text": "12.4 Qualitative report\n1. What edition of APA do we use for the references?\nAPA 7. You can find guidance on this in the following places: OWL Purdue or APA Style\n2. Will there be detailed guidance about each section of the qual report? I.e. word counts, things to cover\nYou can find guidance on this in the qualitative report section\n3. Is our report written in a specific style, e.g. IPA, thematic analysis etc?\nYou must use thematic analysis to analyse your data from the focus group. We are covering this in detail in the lectures and labs.\n4. Will we be able to reuse the information from our group proposal in our qualitative report?\nYou can use the same sources, but must not copy and paste information from your group proposal into your qualitative report. This could be considered as plagiarism, and therefore you must rewrite any information you had in your group proposal that you plan to use for your qualitative report.\n5. Do we need to make/outline study objectives in the introduction? And can they be different to the whole group or can this be decided alone?\nIt would be good to broadly state the aim of the study in your introduction. As long as it’s relevant to the data you collected, there is some flexibility in the individual part of the project.\n6. Do we have to write about the ethical considerations in the methods section of our qualitative project?\nYes, although you do not have the space to go into lots and lots of detail. So, you could mention anonymity and confidentiality, for example, and how you dealt with this in your group. You could also mention the steps you took to make participants feel comfortable.\n7. Will the qualitative report guide include estimate word counts for each section of the report?\nWe have suggested word counts for each section in the Qualitative report section. Please note that these are not set in stone, but give an indication of how you might want to break down the report.\n8. I take it that we are meant to indicate if we are using a constructionist or realist/experientialist framework for the analysis. Are we free to choose this or are there any recommendations? I would assume that focusing on semantic themes is more doable given the limited word count? Also, where would we state this? In the methods section or at the start of the analysis?\nYes, you should mention the theoretical perspective you have taken with your analysis in your Methods section. This should not be extensive (a sentence or two would suffice). Try to tell us why you have chosen the particular approach that you have.\nIt’s important to take the word limit into account, so it could well be the case that focusing at a semantic level will be more doable - the key thing in your analysis is that you try to go beyond description, and develop a narrative.\n9. According to Braun and Clarke (2013) a good analysis section will link back to relevant research previously done on the topic (i.e citations to link it to the wider literature) however, i would presume that this will be better suited to the discussion section of our project given the word count? Or should we cite previous research to link our themes within the analysis section?\nQual reports are written in one of two ways: 1) where the analysis and discussion are in separate sections - in the analysis, you report your findings, in the discussion, you link your findings to the literature, identify limitations etc. 2) you have a joint analysis and discussion section, where you both present your results and link them to the research. Braun & Clarke are talking about the second, whereas we’re doing the first option. Although there are excellent reasons to do the second, this is an introductory course and we want to keep things as simple as possible to help build you up towards your dissertation. Therefore, your report should follow the usual report structure, meaning you should focus on presenting your themes in the analysis section - like with the quant report, you will then have a separate Discussion section where you link to the literature.\n11. In the thematic analysis, what should we do if two participants give opposite answers for the same questions. how do we deal with that conflict?\nThis can make for a really interesting analysis and discussion section! You should explain the theme for the reader, and provide context for the different views presented by the participants. You can find more information in the Braun & Clarke (2013) book\n12. Can you increase the word count for the report? I don’t think 3000 words is high enough for qualitative.\nNo, it is not possible to increase the word count for the report. It is a tight word count, yes, but is an excellent opportunity for you to develop your ability to write succinctly and concisely. This will serve you well as you proceed to your dissertation, as I still have students tell me that they are struggling to cut lots of words despite the much larger word count!"

Arts-based approaches allow for data collection which is less formal than an interview/focus group situation might be and they give the participant space to express themselves more freely. Diary studies allow for data collection over time without overburdening the participants, while data scraping is very sueful when working with sensitive topics and/or minority populations that are hard to reach or overburdened by research participation requests.\n\nDr Gail Prasad’s study explores children’s views of plurilingualism through collage-creation.

    "text": "A.2 Qualitative Research Showcase 2 - Participatory Research\nParticipatory research refers to the involvement of the groups that are affected by the issue that is being studied. It is becoming increasingly more utilised in qualitative research, and it is considered good practice particularly in the areas where the studied group is disadvantaged or marginalised. The underlying philosophy of participatory research is to see the people studied not as “subjects” to research, but actively participating stakeholders.\n\nDrs Vaughn and Jacquez have written an excellent review of the different types and core principles of participatory research.

Pay particular attention to the Community Involvement section of the article. Access the article\n\nDissertation hint: If you want to work with marginalised or disadvantaged populations for your dissertation, have a conversation early on with your supervisor about how you might want to incorporate participatory elements into your study. Due to the limited timescale, for dissertations this often looks less fully fledged than what you would see in published papers. For example, for a dissertation, the researcher student might have lived experience themselves, or they might reach out to University networks to find a person with lived experience to review the research question and/or analysis."
